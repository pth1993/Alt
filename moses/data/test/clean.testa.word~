SOCCER - SHEARER NAMED AS ENGLAND CAPTAIN .
LONDON <number>
The world 's costliest footballer Alan Shearer was named as the new England captain on Friday .
The <number> , who joined Newcastle for <number> million pounds sterling ( $ <number> million ) , takes over from Tony Adams , who led the side during the European championship in June , and former captain David Platt .
Adams and Platt are both injured and will miss England 's opening World Cup qualifier against Moldova on Sunday .
Shearer takes the captaincy on a trial basis , but new coach Glenn Hoddle said he saw no reason why the former Blackburn and Southampton skipper should not make the post his own .
" I 'm sure there wo n't be a problem , I 'm sure Alan is the man for the job , " Hoddle said .
" There were three or four people who could have done it but when I spoke to Alan he was up for it and really wanted it .
" In four days it 's very difficult to come to a <number> percent conclusion about something like this ...
but he knows how to conduct himself , his team mates respect him and he knows about the team situation even though he plays up front . "
Shearer 's Euro <number> striking partner Teddy Sheringham withdrew from the squad with an injury on Friday .
He will probably be replaced by Shearer 's Newcastle team mate Les Ferdinand .

TENNIS - TARANGO , O'BRIEN SPRING TWIN UPSETS UNDER THE LIGHTS .
Larry Fine
NEW YORK <number>
Andre Agassi escaped disaster on Thursday but Wimbledon finalist MaliVai Washington and Marcelo Rios were not so fortunate on a night of upsets at the U.S. Open .
The <number> Washington fell short of reprising his Wimbledon miracle comeback as he lost to red-hot wildcard Alex O'Brien <number> <number> <number> <number> <number> in a two hour <number> minute struggle on the Stadium court .
Next door on the grandstand , <number> seed Rios lost to another player with a Wimbledon connection -- bad boy Jeff Tarango .
The temperamental left-hander defeated the Chilean <number> <number> <number> <number> .
The day programme went smoothly although sixth-seeded former champion Agassi had to wriggle out of a dangerous <number> <number> hole , winning <number> of the last <number> games against India 's Leander Paes .
But the night belonged to the upstarts .
Washington , who climbed back from a <number> deficit , two sets down in the third set against Todd Martin in the Wimbledon semifinals , looked poised for another sensational comeback .
O'Brien , a winner two weeks ago in New Haven for his first pro title , served for the match at <number> in the third set before Washington came charging back .
" I just kept saying to myself , ' keep giving yourself the best chance to win , keep battling , maybe something will happen , ' " said the <number> O'Brien , ranked <number> .
" I kept my composure and I was proud of myself for that -- usually I would have folded up the tent and gone home . "
The hard-serving O'Brien , a former U.S. collegiate national champion , fired up <number> aces to ultimately subdue the never-say-die Washington .
The fifth set stayed on serve until the sixth game , when Washington , after saving one break point with a forehand winner down the line , netted a backhand to give O'Brien a <number> lead .
The Texan blasted in two aces to hold serve at <number> and then converted his eighth match point for victory when Washington found the net with another backhand from <number> .
" You just kind of keep fighting and you keep trying to make him play a little bit .
I think he got a little tight at a couple of moments , " said Washington . "
But I think he served pretty well when he had to . "
Tarango , whose Wimbledon tantrum two years ago brought him a $ <number> fine and suspension from this year 's tournament at the All-England Club , argued calls and taunted fans in his lively two hour , <number> minute tango with Rios on the grandstand .
A boisterous cheering section backed the distracted Chilean and booed the lanky American , who ate up all the attention .
" I 'm an emotional player , " said the <number> Tarango . "
I think I played very well tonight , very focused . "
The match turned on the third-set tiebreaker , which the American won <number> much to the dismay of the spectators .
" I love the crowd if they boo me every day .
It fires me up , makes me play my best tennis , " Tarango said .
" I played some of my best tennis in college when fraternities were throwing beer on me .
If tennis was like that every day , I think everybody wold be having a lot more fun . "
Rios did not appreciate Tarango 's antics .
" He 's always complaining too much , " said Rios . "
But I think it 's not that .
I think I played really bad .
It was tough to play at night .
Balls were going really fast .
I lost too many points that I never lose .
I did n't play my tennis . "
" I do n't see the ball like I see during the day .
I play an American so that 's why I play at night .
I did n't feel good on the court . "
At the end of the match , Tarango blew sarcastic kisses to the crowd , then jiggled his body to a Rios rooting section in a jeering salute .
" I support their enthusiasm , " Tarango said about the fans . "
At the same time , they 're cheering blatantly against me .
After I won I figured I could give them a little razzle-dazzle . "

That 's always been the worst part of my game .
All in all , playing bad 's been a good experience . "

Estes , whose only win came at the <number> Texas Open and whose best finish this year was a third-place tie at the Nortel Open in January , eagled the par-five fourth hole and added five birdies to grab sole possession of second place .

Primary dealers immediately sold Eurodollar and bond futures , after the market on average was expecting the index to rise marginally to <number> from July 's <number> .

Earlier in the day , Fed chairman Alan Greenspan said at the annual Jackson Hole symposium that the goal of price stability is within reach for major nations .

Douglas & Lomason shares rise on merger .

Shares of Douglas & Lomason Co were up <number> at <number> Friday afternoon after Thursday 's announcement that the vehicle seat maker had agreed to be acquired by Magna International Inc for $ <number> a share , or $ <number> million .
Magna was up <number> to <number> on the New York Stock Exchange .
Douglas & Lomason has <number> million common shares outstanding , some of which are option shares to be purchased at exercise prices less than the $ <number> offered price .
The acquisition will beef up Markham , Ontario-based Magna 's North American car and truck seating business , allowing it to better compete with Johnson Controls Inc and Lear Corp .
Family-controlled Douglas & Lomason , which had <number> revenue of $ <number> million , was finding it more difficult to compete for new seating contracts from vehicle makers , said James Hoey , chief financial officer .
" Unfortunately , in the auto industry these days , a $ <number> million company is not a big company anymore , " Hoey said . "
This merger makes us much more competitive . "
He added that Douglas & Lomason 's top executives have been asked to stay on with Magna after the merger , though their future roles have not yet been defined .
Douglas & Lomason 's profits were hurt in the past year by model changeovers , which had reduced production at some important customers , but are now recovering , analysts said .
The company earned $ <number> million on sales of $ <number> million in the first six months of <number> , up from year-earlier earnings of $ <number> million on sales of $ <number> million .
Ford plans to cut its roster of <number> tier-one suppliers -- those it deals with directly -- in half over the next five years .
" The deal really levels the seating field somewhat , " said John Casesa of Schroder Wertheim & Co . "
It should give Magna the critical mass to be a bigger player in that market . "
Magna 's traditional strength has been instrument panels , door panels and other interior components .
Magna , Johnson Controls and Lear have been working to build up their capabilties to supply complete interiors to automakers , including seats , instrument panels , door panels carpeting and headliners .

Iraqi captors of Sudanese jet charged with hijack .
LONDON <number>
Seven Iraqis who seized a Sudanese airliner with <number> people aboard and forced it to fly to London were on Friday charged with hijack , ending speculation that they might be offered immediate asylum in Britain .
Police said the seven men , who freed all their hostages after the plane landed at Stansted airport on Tuesday and then appealed for asylum , would appear in court on Saturday .
The Iraqis claimed they were " ordinary people persecuted by the regime of Saddam ( Hussein ) " but interior ministry officials had consistently said it was likely the seven would be charged with hijack before any plea for asylum was considered .
Under English law the maximum sentence for hijack is life imprisonment , but there has been widespread speculation that the seven will receive lesser sentences and then be allowed to stay rather than being sent back to Iraq .
The hijack began on Monday when an Amman-bound plane was taken over shortly after it took off from Khartoum .
The hijackers threatened to blow it up during a refuelling stop in Cyprus unless they were taken to London .
After a search of the aircraft following the hijackers ' surrender , police found only knives and fake explosives .

Lebed said he had a telephone conversation with Yeltsin late on Thursday but gave no details .

Ruling Moslem party ends vote boycott .
SARAJEVO <number>
Bosnia 's ruling Moslem nationalist party on Friday called on its refugee voters to end a boycott of absentee balloting in national elections , citing assurances provided by a U.S. envoy , government radio said .
The Bosnian government radio broadcast said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John Kornblum had reassured SDA officials , including presumably its leader , Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic , whom he met during a Friday visit .
But the radio report did not specify what guarantees , if any , the U.S. envoy had provided .
Absentee voting in the elections began on Wednesday , August <number> and runs for a week .
Election day for those living inside Bosnia is September <number> .
The Party of Democratic Action ( SDA ) had called on Wednesday for its followers abroad to boycott the absentee balloting because of voter registration irregularities , especially among Serb refugees .
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) postponed municipal elections as a result of the irregularities but decided to proceed with voting for higher offices .
The SDA , joined by two other parties , has been demanding that OSCE prohibit refugees voting from any place other than their pre-war place of residence as a means to prevent the elections from ratifying the results of ethnic cleansing .

Top Belarus politician blasts president .
Larisa Sayenko
MINSK <number>
A senior Belarus politician accused President Alexander Lukashenko on Friday of attempting to set up a dictatorship in the former Soviet republic .
The speaker of the Belarus parliament , Semyon Sharetsky , told Reuters that a draft constitution , due to be put to a national referendum on November <number> , would dangerously increase the powers of the ruler .
" The world community should not be indifferent to the fact that President Lukashenko , who leads this European state of <number> million people , is trying to establish a dictatorship with his new constitution , " Sharetsky said .
The new constitution calls for a two-chamber parliament with a <number> majority-elected house of representatives and a regionally-represented senate with a third of its members named by the president .
Lukashenko 's aides shrugged off Sharetsky 's charge . "
If there was a dictatorship they would n't have the right to say things like this , " Sergei Posukhov , Lukashenko 's political adviser , told Reuters .
" The people have asked us to establish order and that 's our main aim . "
Lukashenko , <number> , won presidential polls in <number> on promises to restore order , fight corruption and repair the strong links with Russia that were disrupted by the collapse of the Soviet Union .
But during his period in office he has battled against nationalist opponents , trade unions and parliament and Sharetsky said the current parliament was ready to try to impeach him .
" This constitution , which has been prepared in secret , aims to gather all power in one man 's hands , " he said . "
We should not be fooled by his quasi-democratic rhetoric and his methods , like this referendum . "
Lukashenko signed a pact with Moscow in April to create a strong economic and political union which he believes could grow into a federation .
But nationalist groups , scared by the prospect of renewed Moscow domination and Russia 's backing for Lukashenko , protested against the deal .
Lukashenko responded by cracking down on the nationalist opposition and jailing nearly <number> people for taking part in demonstrations against the pact .
The United States last week granted political asylum to two opposition leaders , Zenon Poznyak and Sergei Naumchik .

Tajik troops now control devastated town .

TAVILDARA , Tajikistan <number>
Tajik government troops now control of the strategically vital town of Tavildara after driving out Islamic rebels , but sporadic gunfire still echoed in the nearby Pamir mountains on Friday .
The commander-in-chief of Tajikistan 's armed forces , Major-General Nikolai Sherbatov , took a group of journalists by helicopter to the remote , and now devastated , town to show that his forces held it .
He said his troops took Tavildara without casualties on August <number> , but the crack of sniper and machinegun fire revealed the presence of opposition fighters in the surrounding mountains .
Sherbatov said the rebels were located about three km ( two miles ) east of Tavildara around the village of Layron .
Tavildara , <number> km ( <number> miles ) east of the capital Dushanbe , was in ruins .
Shells had smashed roofs and windows and empty shell cases littered the streets .
The town straddles a strategically important road linking government and rebel-held territory and has fallen succesively to both sides in a bloody tug-of-war which began last February .
Tajikistan , which borders Afghanistan and China , has been split by a dragging four-year conflict after a civil war between communists and a frail coalition of Islamic and liberal groups .
Tens of thousands of people have been killed and many more have been displaced in the fighting , which breached a shaky United Nations-sponsored ceasefire .
Tavildara is now apparently inhabited only by a few old men , women and their grubby , barefoot children .
Fruit remained on the trees as there was no one to pick it .
" Help me , help me , " said a chorus of women begging soldiers for food .
The town 's school and a shop doubling as a warehouse for humanitarian aid were destroyed in the fighting .
" We had to build our own earth shelters to survive the fighting , " said Rajab Adinayev , a bearded elderly Tajik in a long white shirt .
Although shy in front of the government soldiers , several inhabitants accused government forces of widespread looting of homes and livestock .
They also said rebel fighters had looted medicines from the local hospital .
One elderly man , who declined to give his name , said two of his sons were now refugees in Moscow and the other two had left to fight for the opposition .
He also said government soldiers had raped the wife of one of his sons . "
It 's not important who holds this town , we just need to stop the war , " he said .

Far East gold traders thumped foreheads in frustration at the market 's foot-dragging this week and forecast on Friday that next week would not be much better .
The Southeast Asian gold market was more or less a photo-fit picture of the previous week 's position with activity slow and bullion prices trapped in a well-worn range awaiting a seasonal upturn in demand and prices into the fourth quarter .
Singapore premiums for Australian kilo bars were quoted unchanged at between <number> cents an ounce over spot loco London prices , with South Korean and Indonesian-origin premiums also steady at <number> cents an ounce .
Singapore dealers said they were concerned that there had been a marked revival in offers to sell gold by South Korean traders , following the distress sales of recent months after the Seoul government 's crackdown on bullion arbitrage trade .
" I was shocked to see these offers coming in again , though there 's been no indication of price or volume .
I dread to think what will happen to the premiums if the Koreans start selling in force , " one dealer said .
Continued dishoarding of kilo-bars by Indonesian sources ahead of next year 's presidential election has also kept a lid on premiums .
Gold closed down at $ <number> / $ <number> an ounce in Hong Kong on Friday , versus New York 's $ <number> / $ <number> finish on Thursday .
Dealers said the precious metal eased on a report that the International Monetary Fund might sell some of its gold to reduce the debts of the poorest developing countries .

" We have chosen the challenge because it is our only option , " proclaimed one banner on the road to Tripoli airport which serves only internal flights because of the sanctions .

Three African leaders -- from Niger , Guinea and Ghana -- are expected to attend the celebrations marking September <number> , <number> when a group of young army officers , led by a <number> Gaddafi , deposed King Mohammed Idris .
" The revolution has brought us great achievements ...

Twilight zone for Wall Street as political race heats up .
Pierre Belec
NEW YORK <number>
For Wall Street , this is the season to be cautious as the presidential contest puts the stock market in the twilight zone .
President Clinton , Bob Dole and Ross Perot are hitting the road now that the partying is over , and people who have billions of dollars invested in stocks were bracing for political promises that could have an impact on their wealth .
Analysts believe that the candidates will add to the market 's list of uncertainties , which already includes the question of whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to cool economic growth .
They say the politicians will need to promote legislation that helps the economy without scaring the socks off financial markets .
" The worst thing that could happen for financial markets is that if Clinton and Dole start to trade shots in the middle of the ring with one-upmanship , " said Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. " That 's when Wall Street will need to worry . "
He said that the bond market would be the first to react if the " bidding " intensifies and stocks would quickly drop as interest rates rise .
" I do n't think it would imply the collapse of the stock market , unless the rise in rates touches off a dynamic within the market , which would include selling by portfolio managers , redemptions by individuals of mutual funds that would , in turn , pressure the portfolio managers to sell even more stock . "
This week , the market weighed Dole 's proposal to lower federal income taxes by <number> percent across the board , a package that carries a price tag of $ <number> billion .
Clinton proposes an $ <number> billion re-election agenda that would spare most home-sellers from capital gains taxes and give employers tax incentives to hire people off the welfare rolls .
Clinton claims Dole 's plan would increase the deficit , while the White House said some corporate taxes would be raised to offset the cost of the president 's plan .
The experts said there are some unusual risks for the market from this year 's political season because the rush to promise tax cuts to win votes could upset Wall Street 's expectations that Washington will balance the budget .
" The stock market will have to edit the promises and then do a probability study on those edited promises , " said John Geraghty at the consulting firm North American Equity Services .
During the past four presidential elections , the candidate that has favoured tax cuts has won .
Ronald Reagan 's tax cut won him a second four-year term in the White House in <number> , while Democrat Walter Mondale , who promised higher taxes , lost .
George Bush became president in <number> on his no-new-tax campaign and Clinton won in <number> with a promise to fatten workers ' paychecks .
The trick , they said , will be for the candidates to continue to convince Wall Street that the Treasury 's <number> bond -- the most closely-watched interest rate -- will fall to between <number> percent and <number> percent by the end of the decade .
Johnson said that long-term interest rates have already been spooked by the election .
The long-term bond jumped this week to <number> percent after starting the year at <number> percent .
The surge of buying in stocks during the last two years has come amid an environment of low interest rates , which has boosted corporate profits .
But the market stalled this summer after the Dow Jones industrial average set a record high of <number> points on May <number> .
" The market does n't seem to be able to make new highs and it has been back and forth in a fairly horizontal mode which looks like a holding pattern , " said Geraghty .
He said the market reflects the political uncertainty , now that Dole has sharply narrowed the gap with Clinton in the polls .
Geraghty said that the one thing that could completely turn the election around are new findings in the Whitewater scandal that would damage the Clintons .
" Stocks are on a delicate edge because if something happens that looks like it could upset the presidency , it could throw the political and , to some extent the economic , process into chaos , " Geraghty said .
Right now , Wall Street is pondering the candidates .
" We have an election where there are so many unknown variables that most people will probably want to hold fire , and even take the chance that they will have to pay higher prices for stocks after the November election , than take the risk that a shock to the system will hurt the stock market , " Geraghty said .

Brisk economic reports rattle markets anew .

WASHINGTON <number>
Factory orders rose in July and manufacturing surged in the Midwest in August , reports said Friday , sparking worries about inflation that battered financial markets for a second straight day .
The Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods climbed <number> percent in July to a seasonally adjusted $ <number> billion -- nearly twice the increase that had been expected .
Shipments of everything from new cars to food items rose , as did order backlogs , in a sign that the strength in the industrial sector would continue in coming months .
A separate report from Chicago area purchasing managers underlined the strength in manufacturing as the group 's barometer of manufacturing in the region jumped to <number> in August from <number> in July .
A reading above <number> indicates growth in manufacturing .
While production and orders rose at Midwest area businesses , the prices they paid for goods used in manufacturing remained well in check .
Analysts said the reports implied the economy was not slowing down in the third quarter after a burst of growth in the spring , and that the lull in late June and July was more temporary than Federal Reserve policy-makers had wanted .
" It appears that August is showing an economy again reversing course and is not moving onto a significantly slower track at this point , " said economist Lynn Reaser of Barnett Banks Inc. in Jacksonville , Fla .
The reports fanned worries on Wall Street that the Fed , the nation 's central bank , would raise rates next month in a bid to ward off inflation , driving stock and bond prices sharply lower for a second day running .
The <number> Treasury fell almost a point , raising its yield , which moves in the opposite direction from the price , to <number> percent from <number> percent late Thursday .
The Dow Jones industrial average fell <number> points to <number> after a <number> decline Thursday .
A third report from the Commerce Department , on July personal income and spending , pointed to a potential slowdown in consumer spending that some analysts said may help moderate growth in the second half .
It showed spending rose only <number> percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ <number> trillion after dropping a revised <number> percent in June .
Incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources gained <number> percent to a rate of $ <number> trillion after a <number> percent jump in June .
July 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest in six months , since January when they were flat .
Economist Joel Naroff of First Union bank in Philadelphia said consumer spending , which fuels two-thirds of the nation 's economy , may be much slower in the third quarter than in the first half , which should slow economic growth .
" The FOMC ( Federal Open Market Committee ) has been forecasting a slowing in economic activity and moderating household demand will have a large impact on overall economic growth , " Naroff said in a written comment .
The policy-making FOMC is to meet on Sept .
<number> to plot interest-rate strategy .
It already has adopted a bias toward raising rates to keep a lid on wage and price rises and help sustain the <number> / <number> economic expansion .
In an interview on the cable television network CNBC Friday , Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence Lindsey said there still were " mixed signals " about the economy 's direction .
" I think that , on balance , it is looking a little bit on the strong side , " Lindsey said .
He added that with expansion as solid as it is and with unemployment so low " the greater risks are clearly that we might see some overheating . "
While July consumer spending rose only slightly , there were ample indications that consumers remained confident .
The University of Michigan 's August index of consumer sentiment , made available on Friday to paying subscribers , rose to <number> from <number> in July .
Reaser said strong consumer confidence coupled with relatively lean inventories were providing manufacturers with a reason to gear up production .
" The economy is not going to be expanding at the <number> percent ( annual ) rate that we had in the second quarter but it is likely to keep expanding in the <number> percent range , " she said , above the <number> percent to <number> percent that the Fed considers to be non-inflationary .
New orders to factories were strong for durable goods like new cars and for nondurables like paper and food products .
Orders for durable goods , meant to last three years or more , rose a revised <number> percent in July after falling <number> percent in June .
Orders for nondurables jumped <number> percent following a <number> percent decrease in June .

Mexican avocados not expected in U.S .
Maggie McNeil
WASHINGTON <number>
U.S. Agriculture Department officials said Friday that Mexican avocados -- which are restricted from entering the continental United States -- will not likely be entering U.S. markets any time soon , even if the controversial ban were lifted today .
" The opportunity to import ( Mexican avocados ) probably wo n't become possible for another year , " said Paul Drazek , senior trade advisor to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman .
" We could lift the ban tomorrow , but that would not mean anything immediately , " said Drazek . "
We probably would not see avacados come in until next season , next November . "
The Agriculture Department proposed more than a year ago to significantly ease an <number> ban on Mexican avocados .
Under the administration 's proposal , the borders to the Mexican produce would be opened into <number> Northern and Northeastern states from November through February .
The plan has raised a storm of protest from U.S. avocado growers , who are largely concentrated in California .
California growers have charged that removing the restrictions , even on a limited basis , would endanger the $ <number> billion U.S. industry if potentially harmful Mexican insects were brought into the country along with the avocados .
Mexican officials contend that there is no scientific basis for the ban , and that it is illegal under international trading rules of the World Trade Organisation .
Proponents of the plan discount the worries of the U.S. growers and say the plan has enough safeguards built into it to eliminate any significant threat to American producers .
Under the proposal , only imports of export-quality avocados growing in approved orchards in Michoacan , Mexico , the country 's main avocado area , would be allowed .
Mexican growers and distributors would have to abide by strict rules established by the Mexican and U.S. agriculture agencies .
The California Avocado Commission -- which has spearheaded the opposition to lifting the ban -- said new data the group submitted to the Agriculture Department last spring shows the department underestimated the pest problem in Mexico and have urged that the agency reopen its study of the issue .
The administration is still studying the new data , and officials have said that if experts think the information is significant , the agency could reopen its investigation .
But U.S. avocado industry sources said that while they may have delayed the plan for a while , they ultimately do not expect the administration to change its position .
" From a common-sense view , the department should reconsider this plan , but due to politics they will probably go ahead with this , " said Tom Bellamore of the California avocado group .
Administration officials said they want to get the issue resolved as quickly as possible , but said there is no timetable they are working under .
" It 's a very complicated issue , " said the Agriculture Department 's Drazek . "
We 'll get it resolved as quickly as we can , based on the best available science . "

U.S. Cardinal Bernardin says has terminal cancer .
CHICAGO <number>
Chicago Cardinal Joseph Bernardin , head of the second-largest U.S. Roman Catholic archdiocese , said on Friday his doctors had diagnosed him as having liver cancer and he had a year or less to live .
Bernardin , <number> , underwent extensive surgery for pancreatic cancer in June <number> followed by months of chemotherapy , which he said made him more aware of his own vulnerabilities and the need to minister to the sick .
" On Wednesday , examinations indicated that the cancer has returned , this time in the liver .
I am told that it is terminal and that my life expectancy is one year or less , " a composed Bernardin told a news conference .
In <number> years as Chicago 's archbishop , he built a prayerful , saintly image and was deeply involved in world church issues and publicly committed to rooting out abuses by clergy .
" I have been assured that I still have some quality time left , " he said , saying he would undergo a new form of chemotherapy but his doctors have told him there was only a slim chance of a cure and the liver cancer was inoperable .
" It 's not going to be easy to say goodbye to everybody .
Death does have some sad dimensions to it but I am a man of faith , " he said . "
Death is a natural phenomenom . "
He said he would " serve until the end " as cardinal .
Pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly forms of the disease , although Bernardin 's case was caught early .
Surgeons removed a cancerous kidney , parts of his pancreas and stomach , small intestine , bile duct and surrounding tissues .
He made a rapid recovery and resumed most of his duties , but then developed a deteriorating condition in his spine that caused him great pain and shortened his height by several inches .
He was scheduled to undergo back surgery next month , but that was cancelled when the cancer was discovered in his liver in order to avoid delaying the start of chemotherapy .
The spare , soft-spoken son of an Italian stonecutter took over the Chicago archdiocese , the nation 's second-largest after Los Angeles , with <number> million parishioners , in <number> .
Ironically , Bernardin , who developed a progressive , much-praised programme to deal with pedophilia involving priests , became the highest-ranking church official ever accused of sexual improprieties when a former seminary student leveled charges in <number> that he had been sexually abused by Bernardin during the <number> .
Bernardin steadfastly denied the charges and the former student later recanted his tale of abuse .
Bernardin prayed with him before he died from AIDS last year .
Bernardin , who became archbishop of Cincinnati in <number> , played an increasingly prominent role in the U.S. church as a moderate voice of compromise among liberals and conservatives in the ranks of the bishops .
This month , he announced that he would oversee a series of conferences to find " common ground " among American Catholics .
Previously , he was instrumental in drafting church policy on war , peace and nuclear arms , and for seven years he headed the bishops ' anti-abortion policy committee , espousing a policy describing human life as a " seamless garment . "

Boatmen 's deal could spark more mergers .
Brad Dorfman
CHICAGO <number>
The $ <number> billion proposed acquisition of Boatmen 's Bancshares Inc. by NationsBank Corp. could spark a flurry of other mergers involving Missouri banks , which until last year were protected from outside buyers by state regulations .
" NationsBank just strolled into the Midwest and bagged the biggest banking trophy in the landscape , " said Michael Ancell , banking industry analyst at Edward D. Jones & Co . "
Whoever wants a big market position in the Midwest has to come in and grab Mercantile or Commerce . "
St. Louis-based Mercantile Bancorp Inc. , a bank holding company with $ <number> billion in assets , was seen by many analysts as the most attractive Missouri franchise in size after Boatmen 's .
Kansas City , Mo.-based Commerce Bancshares Inc. , with $ <number> billion in assets , also could help a regional bank establish a strong presence in the lower Midwest , analysts added .
" It focuses more attention on Mercantile , Commerce and Roosevelt , " said James Weber , analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons .
Roosevelt Financial Group Inc is a $ <number> billion asset-St .
Louis based thrift .
" Now ... the most coveted bank out there is Mercantile , " Weber said .
Mercantile and Commerce did not return phone calls seeking comment .
Among those seen as having an interest in buying in Missouri are Minneapolis-based First Bank System Inc. and Norwest Corp. , Ohio-based KeyCorp and Banc One Corp. , and First Chicago NBD Corp. in Illinois .
Representatives of First Bank , Norwest , Banc One and First Chicago said the banks do not comment on rumors of possible mergers or acquisitions .
KeyCorp , contacted by phone , would not comment .
With a presence in nine states and $ <number> billion in assets ,
Boatmen 's was the prize in Missouri , where barriers to outside acquirers were brought down last year by a federal banking statute .
" Boatmen 's was the plum of Missouri and was the plum of the central Midwest , " Weber said .
Talk that the Missouri banks were seeking inflated prices from buyers was seen as a reason a deal has not occurred sooner .
But NationsBank 's bid , representing a premium of <number> percent for Boatmen 's stock , was large enough to get the deal done .
" I think Boatmen 's was shopping itself , and everybody knew if you wanted to be the winning buyer here , you had to make the bid nobody would beat , " Ancell said .
But some analysts cautioned that other targets should not expect as large a premium .
They also questioned whether NationsBank can recoup shareholder value with such a large bid for Boatmen 's .
" I think initially some stocks will trade up on sympathy , but the wild premium NationsBank put on this deal here , I do n't see a lot of other deals being done at this premium , " said Michael Durante , analyst at McDonald & Co .

U.S. tight-lipped on Libya 's award to Farrakhan .
WASHINGTON <number>
The State Department refused to speculate on Friday on what might happen in the case of Louis Farrakhan , the U.S. black leader who was awarded a $ <number> human rights prize by Libya .
" I 'm not going to speculate about what may or may not happen in that case , " State Department spokesman Glyn Davies said . "
... The view of the U.S. government on ( Farrakhan 's ) not accepting any gifts from Libya is well-known . "
Davies also noted : " We 've talked about the passport restriction for travel to Libya " but he did not elaborate .
The U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday denied Farrakhan 's application to receive the $ <number> award or a $ <number> billion donation Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had pledged to Farrakhan 's Nation of Islam group after they met last January .
Farrakhan organised last October 's Million Man March that brought thousands of black men to Washington for a peaceful rally .
The Treasury Department said Libya was on the U.S. list of states that sponsor international terrorism and noted that Tripoli has refused to hand over two Libyan suspects in the <number> bombing of Pan Am flight <number> over Lockerbie , Scotland .
That refusal led to the imposition of U.N. sanctions on Libya .

Bonn appeals for Middle East peace .
BONN <number>
The German government urged Israelis and Palestinians on Friday to avoid any course of action that might jeopardise the peace process in the Middle East .
Israel announced this week the expansion of Jewish West Bank settlements surrounding Jerusalem and the demolition of an Arab community centre in East Jerusalem .
City officials there said the centre was being erected illegally .

France on Friday expelled another African man seized in a police raid on a Paris church as about <number> Air France workers denounced " charters of shame " used to fly illegal immigrants home .
A Guinean man , detained in a round-up in the Saint-Bernard church a week ago , was deported on a scheduled Air France flight to Conakry after his appeals failed , a spokesman for Air France 's pro-Socialist CFDT union said .

Syria slams Israel on settlements .
DAMASCUS <number>
Syria on Friday condemned Israel 's settlement policy and said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was preparing for war with Arabs .
" Practices of the Israeli government , especially its settlement activities , came to confirm that dealing with this government inflicts the biggest harm on the Arab cause , " state-run Damascus Radio said in a commentary .
" When this government insists on stabbing the peace process and tearing it apart , this means that it is preparing for war , " the radio said .
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat described this week the decision to expand settlements in the West Bank as a declaration of war .
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza observed a strike on Thursday to protest against the Israeli move .
The radio urged Arabs to unify their ranks to thwart the policies of the right-wing Israeli government .
" Israel could not confront a united Arab stand or usurp their rights because the Arab rights could be regained when they achieve unity and solidarity , " Damascus radio said .
It welcomed the international criticism of Israel 's settlement policies but called for practical steps to force the Israeli government to abandon this policy .
" It is important to translate the criticism into pressuring action to prevent Israel from undermining the big international efforts aimed at making the peace process achieve success , " the radio said .

An Israeli roadblock stopped the <number> Palestinian from answering Yasser Arafat 's call to worship at Jerusalem 's al-Aqsa mosque on Friday .
" Go home .
There are no prayers today , " an Israeli soldier yelled at Jamil in Hebrew .
Palestinian President Arafat , attacking Israel 's decision to expand Jewish settlements and its policy on Jerusalem , went before the Palestinian legislature on Wednesday to urge the two million Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza to go to the holy city .
Pilgrims stood little chance of making progress .
Palestinians have been banned by Israel from travelling from the West Bank to Jerusalem since suicide bombings by Moslem militants killed <number> people in the Jewish state in February and March .
And Israeli checkpoints have circled Jerusalem since <number> , a concrete and constant reminder of Israel 's hold on a city it considers its eternal capital .
The PLO wants Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state .
Only a few Palestinians trickled to the roadblocks .
They were immediately turned back .
" I am heeding Abu Ammar 's ( Arafat 's ) call to pray at al-Aqsa and I came .
It is our duty towards al-Aqsa to come and pray , " Jamil said .
A tourist from Jordan was also told by Israeli soldiers at the al-Ram checkpoint that he could not enter Jerusalem .
" We have a peace treaty with them and we let them go wherever they want when they come to Jordan , " said the tourist , Khaled Hijazi , <number> . "
I feel terrible .
I am entitled to see Jerusalem , " he said .

" Abu Ammar ( Arafat ) is right .
We have signed a peace treaty with the Israelis but on the ground , we see that nothing has changed , " said <number> Ali Ahmed from Qalandia refugee camp .

Consumer spending , incomes edge up in July .
Glenn Somerville
WASHINGTON <number>
Consumer spending barely edged up in July , the Commerce Department said Friday , as income growth slowed abruptly to the weakest pace in six months .
Spending rose <number> percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ <number> trillion after dropping a revised <number> percent in June .
Incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources gained <number> percent to a rate of $ <number> trillion after a <number> percent jump in June .
Department officials said July 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest for any month since January , when they were flat .
Wages and salaries came under pressure in July as a shorter average workweek and lower hourly earnings cut into paychecks .
The department said wages and salaries decreased by $ <number> billion in July after climbing $ <number> billion in June .
" In July , average weekly hours and average hourly earnings declined , more than offsetting the effect of an increase in employment , " Commerce said .
But more money went into savings accounts , as savings held at <number> cents out of each dollar earned in both June and July .
That was the highest savings rate since October last year , when <number> cents out of each dollar earned was being saved .
The generally lackluster report on spending and incomes in July had been expected .
At the same time , the department said in a separate report that new orders received by U.S. factories climbed strongly in July , with widespread gains across most major categories .
Orders increased <number> percent to a seasonally adjusted $ <number> billion , significantly stronger than the <number> percent rise forecast by Wall Street economists .
That followed a revised <number> percent decline in June orders .
Commerce said previously that spending at retail stores was up only <number> percent in July , partly because of softer sales of new cars and light trucks .
In addition , the Labour Department 's July employment report had foreshadowed the muted income growth .
It showed average hourly earnings fell in July by <number> percent to $ <number> and the average workweek shortened to <number> hours from <number> in June .
Gains in personal income , which includes wages and salaries as well as income from sources such as dividends , interest and businesses , are essential for funding consumer purchases , which fuel two-thirds of national economic activity .
Spending on all types of durable goods , which includes cars , fell to an annual rate of $ <number> billion in July from $ <number> billion in June .
But spending on nondurable products increased moderately to a rate of $ <number> trillion from $ <number> trillion in June , while spending for services was up to $ <number> trillion in July from $ <number> trillion .
Payrolls of manufacturing companies rose in July by $ <number> billion to an annual rate of $ <number> billion .

Pirelli cables look to tap Chinese growth .
David Jones
MILAN <number>
Italian tyre and cables giant Pirelli on Friday announced its long-awaited move into China with a cables joint venture set to capitalise on the rapidly-growing Chinese telecommunications market .
Pirelli is linking with Hong Kong-based group CITIC Pacific in a venture to be called the Wuxi Tong Ling Company Ltd , which will operate in partnership with a local industrial company at its existing factory in Wuxi , Jiangsu province , Shanghai .
The partners will invest around $ <number> million in the existing copper cable plant at Wuxi to update technology and include optic fibre production , with annual turnover expected to reach $ <number> million within the next few years .
The move marks a further move by Pirelli 's cables division to expand in the fast-growing Far Eastern developing markets with the group already present in Indonesia , India and Malaysia .
" This is really positive news for Pirelli , and I expect that it will produce one of the best half-year results in late September compared to other industrial Italian companies , " said analyst Paula Buratti at Indosuez .
She emphasised that the move was positive because Pirelli will have management control of the Chinese venture , and it also showed another example of Pirelli exporting its technical know-how to developing markets .
Pirelli shares reacted favourable even though talks had been underway for some time and news about a venture had been widely expected .
The shares rose <number> percent to <number> lire by <number> GMT in an easier Milan stock market .
This will be Pirelli 's first industrial involvement in a Chinese market where demand for telecommunication networks is expected to grow to <number> million new lines between <number> and <number> , doubling demand for optical cables .
China 's second largest telecoms operator Unicom already has a mandate from the central government to establish <number> million new phone lines by the year <number> , which will necessitate new trunk line systems and local distribution networks .
" The starting of this production base in China has for our group an undoubted strategic value , representing an important enhancement of our presence in Asia , " said Pirelli SpA chairman and chief executive officer Marco Tonchetti Provera .
Pirelli Cables has global sales of over $ <number> billion , and has become a large supplier of optic cables and systems to major telecoms carriers in the U.S. , Europe and the Far East .
CITIC Pacific is a major Hong Kong-listed company focusing on infrastruture , trading , distribution and property , with <number> percent of its <number> profits coming from telecoms .
It has investments in several industrial joint ventures in China .

Dutch bond futures revival delayed - EOE .
AMSTERDAM <number>
A broad attempt to spur activity in Dutch bond futures has been delayed to give participants a chance to become familiar with the trading system , the European Options Exchange ( EOE ) said on Friday .
Market-making in the rarely-traded FTO contract was expected to begin today , but an EOE spokesman said the <number> banks and brokers involved in the initiative needed time to get accustomed to changes in the electronic trading system .
" It 's not ready yet .
We found it wise to take some time between the commitment to start and the actual start , " EOE spokesman Lex van Drooge told Reuters .
He said no date had been fixed yet for the start of price making in the <number> contract , but the EOE had agreed to speak again to the participants in one to two weeks .
Investors in Dutch bonds currently use German bond futures to hedge their portfolios because the FTO contract is so illiquid .
A limited attempt to reinvigorate the contract two years ago failed .

OSCE defends record over Chechnya peace mission .
BONN <number>
The head of an international mediating mission defended its record on Friday in the face of criticism by pro-Moscow leaders in breakway Chechnya and insisted it was doing its best to bring peace to the region .
Flavio Cotti , the chairman of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , told German radio the Vienna-based body viewed the conflict in Chechnya as an internal Russian problem .
" The OSCE is completely involved .
But one must not forget that the OSCE only has limited powers there , " said Cotti , who is also the Swiss foreign minister . "
Our mission in Chechnya has done all it can within the given limitations . "
Pro-Moscow leaders in Chechnya have criticised Tim Guldimann , the Swiss diplomat who heads the OSCE Chechnya mission , saying he was biased toward Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev , president of the self-declared separatist government .
Russian peacemaker Alexander Lebed and Chechen separatist military leader Aslan Maskhadov started a new round of peace talks on Friday just outside the rebel region .
Cotti said Chechnya must remain part of Russia , but the solution to the conflict would be to accord the region maximum autonomy within Russia 's borders .
" There is no doubt that Chechnya , according to OSCE principles , belongs to a state called Russia , " he said , pointing out that Russia was an OSCE member and it was not the organisation 's policy to challenge members ' sovereignty .
He added that the OSCE was the only international body which has been allowed into the Chechnya to monitor the human rights situation there , but that its means were restricted by the fact that the conflict was a " internal issue " .
" We have a small concept , the details of which have yet to be worked out .
Chechnya must be accorded the maximum autonomy possible within the framework of Russian integrity , " said Cotti .

The Dutch transport minister Annemarie Jorritsma told the country ' second chamber that there is no further need to investigate the <number> crash of an El Al freighter which left <number> dead in an Amsterdam suburb .
She said that a request from her ministry for the aircraft 's waybill documentation and further information about the contents of its hold had been complied with by El Al 's head office in Tel Aviv .
The Dutch transport ministry had come in for pressure from a cross-section of Dutch members of parliaments in May this year , some of whom believed the aircraft had been carrying unlisted , dangerous goods .
Others said they thought the aircraft was loaded with too much airfreight .
Jorritsma said the latest evidence from El Al in no way supported the allegations , and added there is no justification for a further investigation into the incident .

Armenians , Azeris hold peace talks in Germany .
BONN <number>
Representatives from Armenia and Azerbaijan held talks earlier this week in Germany on bringing a lasting peace to the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region , a diplomatic source close to the talks said on Friday .
The source , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said Azerbaijani presidential adviser Vafa Gulizade and his Armenian counterpart Zhirayr Liparityan met to discuss the disputed enclave on Wednesday and had now flown home .
An uneasy ceasefire has prevailed in Nagorno-Karabakh , which represents around <number> percent of Azeri territory , since May <number> after ethnic Armenians drove Azeris out of the region .
The conflict , which began in <number> , claimed over <number> lives .
" The main subject ( of the talks ) was the search for a peaceful solution for Nagorno-Karabakh , " the source said .
He declined to reveal any more details about the content of the talks or their exact location in Germany .
Azerbaijan has said it is prepared to grant autonomy to Nagorno-Karabakh if Armenian forces pull out , but will not accept Armenia 's demands for the independence of the enclave .
Russia 's Interfax news agency reported on Tuesday the officials had departed for negotiations in Germany , adding that face-to-face talks between the two sides first took place last December in Amsterdam .
Interfax said the discussions were being held in parallel with peace talks mediated by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) and the broad-based Minsk Group of countries led by Russia and Finland .

Sombre mood on Arctic island after plane crash .
Rolf Soderlind
LONGYEAR , Norway <number>
The windblown , chilly streets of this tiny Arctic town are all but deserted and flags are flying at half-mast beneath a brooding , clouded sky .
Longyear is a town in mourning , a close-knit community that has been shattered .
Disaster struck on Thursday when a Russian airliner bringing coal miners to work crashed as it came in to land at the airport , killing all <number> people on board .
" It 's a sight I will never forget .
I will remember it for the rest of my life , " said Stig Onarheim .
He was one of a handful of rescuers who raced to the scene of the crash in a helicopter on Thursday , hoping in vain to find survivors .
The plane smashed into a snow-capped mountain on the Arctic island of Spitzbergen on Thursday , just east of Longyear .
" Imagine a big plane with a lot of luggage and people on board .
Think of all that mixed together , with twisted , wrecked parts on the slope , " Onarheim , <number> , told Reuters .
Police and local officials have sealed off the crash site , protecting it from intrusive reporters and from the polar bears that roam freely across the icy expanses .
The dead were all Russians and Ukrainians , coming to work in the mining towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden .
Longyear is a Norwegian settlement of just over <number> people , but it also feels the loss keenly .
" I have trouble finding the words to express my grief .
It 's a tragedy for everyone .
We know many of the people who live in Barentsburg , some of them could have been on the plane , " said Johan Sletten , <number> .
Sletten , a caretaker who has lived on the island for <number> years , said the Norwegian and Russian communities visit frequently , competing at soccer in the summer and with snow-scooter races in the winter .
Teenage shop assistant Heidi Groenstein was blunter .
" I 'm glad it was not a Norwegian plane , " she said . "
Just think of it -- a mining village where so many workers die .
They must be having a tough time of it now . "
Barentsburg , just a few hours ride by snow-scooter or <number> minutes by helicopter from Longyear , has asked to be left alone with its grief and told reporters to stay away .
Around <number> Russian and Ukrainian miners were waiting in Longyear to fly home on the plane that crashed .
They were given shelter in the town 's church overnight and ate a sombre breakfast before getting on a bus for the airport .
Another plane had been sent from Moscow to pick them up .
At this time of year , the only colour in Longyear comes from the brightly-painted wooden houses .
Everything else is muddy , the waters of the fjord leaden .
Winter is in the air .
Barentsburg is an even grimmer place , a run-down testament to the hardships of the new Russia .
Spitzbergen lies some <number> miles ( <number> km ) off the northern tip of Norway and endures one of the most extreme climates on the planet .
Inhabited by fewer than <number> people in total , it sees the sun for <number> hours a day during summer and is plunged into round-the-clock darkness in the winter months .
The terrain is mountainous , the only roads are dirt tracks .
Norway rules the island group under the terms of a <number> international treaty which gave many other nations the right to establish setttlements and exploit the coal that is still mined there .
Only Russia has chosen to do so .

Security Council members expressed concern on Thursday that Israel 's bulldozing of a Palestinian day-care centre for the disabled might further injure the Middle East peace process .
Responding to a letter from the the Palestinian U.N. observer mission , Security Council President Tono Eitel of Germany said that members asked him to convey their views to Israel 's charge d'affaires , David Peleg .
" The members expressed their concern about the maintenance of the peace process and they urged that no action be taken that would have a negative impact on the negotiations , " Eitel said after an informal council session .
" They asked me to call in the Israeli charge d'affaires and discuss the matter with him , " he added .
The Palestinian letter from Marwan Jilani said the destruction of the Jerusalem centre was an effort by Israel to " alter the character , demographic composition and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem " and violated agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation .
" This most recent measure represents a revival of old , malicious plans to confiscate the land and build units for Israeli settlers within the walls of the Old City . "
" We expect the international community to take a clear and firm position , based on international law and in accordance with U.N. resolutions , against all such Israeli violations and illegal practices , " he said .

SOCCER - REAL SCRAPE <number> DRAW IN SCRAPPY OPENING MATCH .
LA CORUNA , Spain <number>
A late goal by newly-signed defender Roberto Carlos saved the blushes of Real Madrid coach Fabio Capello and his multi-billion peseta line-up in the opening game of the Spanish championship on Saturday .
The Brazilian 's <number> effort was enough to earn Real a point from a scrappy <number> draw at fellow title contenders Deportivo Coruna .
Deportivo started strongly , taking the lead midway through the first half when former Auxerre playmaker Corentine Martins headed home a corner after a flick-on by Brazilian-born Spanish international midfielder Donato .
Real looked to be in deep trouble shortly after the break when Luis Milla was sent off for committing two bookable offences in as many minutes .
But Deportivo were unable to capitalise on their numerical advantage , and were themselves reduced to ten men when Armando Alvarez was sent off <number> minutes from time .
Shortly afterwards Roberto Carlos found space in the home defence and equalised for Real with a shot that was deflected past despairing Deportivo ' keeper Jacques Songo'o .
In a frantic final five minutes there were chances at both ends , and Donato , who had earlier been booked , was sent off for protesting about the incursion of Real players at a free kick .
Before the match Deportivo chairman Augusto Lendoiro said he would ignore a FIFA decision banning Brazilian midfielder Mauro Silva from playing in the match for failing to join his national side 's tour of Europe .
In the event , coach John Toshack decided not to use Silva , who had claimed he did not join the Brazil squad because he had lost his passport .

RUGBY UNION - SPRINGBOKS FINALLY BREAK ALL BLACK SPELL .
Andy Colquhoun
JOHANNESBURG <number>
South Africa managed to avoid a fifth successive defeat in <number> at the hands of the All Blacks with an emphatic <number> victory in front of an ecstatic Ellis Park crowd on Saturday .
They scored three tries in recording their highest total against New Zealand , salvaging some pride in a season in which the world champions have lost five out of eight tests .
It also ended a run of nine successive victories this year for New Zealand but arrived too late to prevent a <number> series defeat and an historic first All Black series triumph on South African soil .
Springbok scrum-half Joost van der Westhuizen was his side 's inspiration , scoring their opening try and making the third for flanker Andre Venter from a quickly taken penalty to give his side a <number> lead after <number> minutes .
Fullback Andre Joubert scored the other , scorching in from <number> metres at the start of the second half to add to his three long-range penalties .
The All Blacks salvaged some pride by scoring two tries from centre Walter Little and scrum-half Justin Marshall in the final five minutes to close a gap which at one point stood at <number> points .
But they generally endured an off-day , highlighted by recalled fly-half Andrew Mehrtens who missed five out of eight kicks at goal .
Recalled fly-half Henry Honiball kicked the Springboks into a <number> lead after <number> minutes only to see Andrew Mehrtens launch a penalty from eight metres inside his own half to narrow the gap .
Mehrtens missed three further penalties and a conversion in the first <number> minutes which could have put his side ahead , but it was the Springboks who looked the more dangerous .
Their promise was realised when Joubert made a <number> break in the <number> minute and , although winger Pieter Hendriks appeared to knock on Joubert 's reverse pass , Welsh referee Derek Bevan allowed Van der Westhuizen to pick up and score under the posts .
Honiball converted and Joubert kicked a penalty before All Black hooker Sean Fitzpatrick scored a try from close range on the stroke of half-time to narrow the lead to <number> and hint at a comeback .
Instead Joubert kicked another long penalty and then raced around the outside of the defence to score the Springboks ' second try .
A quick penalty from Van der Westhuizen five metres from the All Black line set up the third try for Venter five minutes later and when Joubert kicked his third penalty the Springboks held an unassailable <number> lead going into the last quarter .
When the All Blacks did break through , it was too late .
Centre Walter Little followed up Mehrtens ' kick to score under the posts and scrum-half Justin Marshall forced himself over from a ruck close to the line in injury-time to give them some consolation .
South Africa - <number> - Andre Joubert , <number> - Justin Swart , <number> - Japie Mulder ( Joel Stransky , <number> mins ) <number> - Danie van Schalkwyk , <number> - Pieter Hendriks ; <number> - Henry Honiball , <number> - Joost van der Westhuizen ; <number> - Gary Teichmann ( captain ) , <number> - Andre Venter ( Wayne Fyvie , <number> ) , <number> - Ruben Kruge , <number> - Mark Andrews ( Fritz van Heerden , <number> ) , <number> - Kobus Wiese , <number> - Marius Hurter , <number> - James Dalton , <number> - Dawie Theron ( Garry Pagel , <number> ) .

SQUASH - HILL BRANDS WORLD CHAMPION JANSHER A CHEAT .
HONG KONG <number>
Controversial Australian Anthony Hill called Jansher Khan a cheat during his acrimonious defeat by the world number one in the Hong Kong Open semifinals on Saturday .
The match boiled over when Hill made to walk off court after what he claimed was a game-winning point in the third .
When the referee called Jansher 's return good and the decision was accepted by the player , Hill shrieked at the Pakistani : " You cheat . "
" He was standing right there and knew the shot was down so I called him a cheat , " said Hill , whose squash career has been blighted by fines and suspensions for unacceptable behaviour .
" He knew it was down and accepted what I called him because of that . "
Hill won the game on the next point and said later that Jansher was generally honest on court but played by the referee 's decision .
The Australian had upset Jansher 's rhythm with his mixture of gamesmanship and fluent stroke-making but eventually succumbed <number> <number> <number> <number> .
" I changed my strategy against him today and had him rattled , " he added .
He is not as fit as he used to be be but was too good for me in the end .
I shook him a bit but he will come out next time and be a better player for it -- that 's Jansher . "
Jansher said that he was disturbed to be called a cheat . "
What he did was bad for squash , bad for the crowd and bad for the sponsors .
" We are trying to build up squash like tennis and players should not say things like that .
" I think the Professional Squash Association should look into this matter and deal with it properly .
I am not calling for him to be banned but they have to take some action . "
Jansher , bidding for an eighth Hong Kong Open title , plays second-seeded Australian Rodney Eyles in the final .
Eyles played his best squash of the tournament to beat fourth-seeded Peter Nicol of Scotland <number> <number> <number> <number> .
Eyles , who defeated Jansher in the semifinals of the Portuguese Open in <number> , said that he would like to win for the good of the game .
" I have nothing against Jansher but it will be great if I could beat him , " said Eyles . "
My biggest problem against Jansher is concentration .

Whenever everyone 's making birdies , you never want to be even par . "
Henke had a bogey-free round and birdied four holes , including a <number> on the par-three <number> seventh hole and one from <number> feet out on the <number> hole .
" I did n't hit it very well today , " said Henke . "

TENNIS - SPAIN , U.S. TEAMS OPEN ON ROAD FOR <number> FED CUP .
Richard Finn
NEW YORK <number>
This year 's Fed Cup finalists -- defending champion Spain and the United States -- will hit the road to open the <number> women 's international team competition , based on the draw conducted Saturday at the U.S. Open .
Spain travels to Belgium , while the U.S. team heads to the Netherlands for first-round matches March <number> .
The other two first-round ties will pit hosts Germany against the Czech Republic and visiting France against Japan .
The semifinals are July <number> , and the final September <number> <number> .
Life on the road this year did not slow the Americans , who will try to avenge their <number> defeat in the final last year when they host Spain on September <number> in Atlantic City .
" Last year we stood on the court after we had lost and we put out hands together and made it our committment to bring back the Cup , " U.S. captain Billie Jean King said at the draw . "
That is our sole goal . "
The United States edged Austria in Salzburg <number> in the opening round in April , and then blanked Japan <number> in Nagoya last month in the semifinals .
The victory against Japan marked the Fed Cup debut of Monica Seles , who became a naturalised U.S. citizen in <number> .
Seles easily won both her singles matches and King is counting on the co-world number one to lead the team again .
" I told Monica we need her if we want to win , " King said .
Seles 's sore left shoulder and a wrist injury to Fed Cup veteran Mary Joe Fernandez have forced King to take a wait and see attitude regarding her squad for the best-of-five match .
Fernandez was forced to withdraw from the U.S. Open .
" We will wait until the last minute so we check with everybody and their injuries , " said King . "
What we like would be Seles , ( Olympic champion Lindsay ) Davenport and Mary Joe Fernandez . "
If she can get that threesome together , King will feel good about her chances against the Spain 's formidable duo of Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Conchita Martinez .
" To be a great coach you have to have the right horses and I got the right horses , " said King .

TENNIS - EDBERG REFUSES TO QO QUIETLY .
Richard Finn
NEW YORK <number>
Refusing to go quietly in the night , Stefan Edberg extended his stay at his <number> and last U.S. Open when Bernd Karbacher , trailing and hurting , quit in the fourth set of their second-round match Friday .
The <number> Edberg , a former two-time Open champion , had wrestled control of the match away from Karbacher when the German , hampered by a left hamstring injury , decided he could n't continue under the stadium lights at the National Tennis Centre .
" A win is a win .
I 'll take it , " Edberg , who has announced that this will be his last Grand Slam event , said of the <number> <number> <number> <number> victory .
Ironically , Karbacher two years ago ended Ivan Lendl 's Grand Slam career here when the former champion had to retire in the middle of their first-round match .
After seeing the trainer come out early in the third set , Edberg was not surprised by Karbacher 's decision not to go on .
" I knew he had problems with something , " Edberg said . "
I really was n't surprised . "
Edberg had his own problems early in the match as the Swede battled to acclimate himself to the nighttime conditions while Karbacher was ripping passing shots and blasting serves past him .
" I did n't really feel good to begin with , I had problems finding the timing on the ball , seeing the ball , " said Edberg , who upset Wimbledon champion and fifth-seeded Richard Krajicek in the first round .
" This was one of these matches where I did n't play up to my standard .
I had to fight hard . "
Edberg 's tenacity paid off in the second set .
Edberg lost his own serve twice , but he rallied for three breaks of his own , the last to wrap up the set .
" That 's where the match sort of changed , " said Edberg . "
I think once I got that second set , I felt a lot better about my game . "
Edberg is starting to feel pretty good about postponing his swan song a lot longer .
" It does n't look all that bad , " Edberg said of his path through the draw starting next with a match against Krajicek 's Dutch countryman Paul Haarhuis .
However , the <number> and <number> champion is not ready to start making plans to be in next week 's final .
" I 'm always being realistic , " said Edberg . "
Like I said many times , I think it 's a very little chance , but nothing is impossible .
If I play great tennis , that could take me a long way .
" A lot of things can happen , like tonight . "

VIENNA <number>
Austria dominated their World Cup group four qualifier against Scotland on Saturday with wave after wave of attacks but were unable to penetrate the visitors ' defence and had to settle for a goalless draw .
Scotland , who thrashed Belarus <number> in their opening group four match , were unable to repeat their performance .
Austria 's best chance came in the <number> minute with Stephan Marasek of SC Freiburg taking advantage of a scramble in the Scottish penalty area but his shot narrowly passing the left-hand post .
They also went close a minute before the interval when a promising attack saw the ball fall to Markus Schopp but he hit his shot wide .
Everton 's Duncan Ferguson went close for Scotland in the <number> minute when he forced Austrian goalkeeper Michael Konsel to a diving save .
Two Scotland players were shown yellow cards , captain Gary McAllister for bringing down Andreas Heraf and Ferguson for arguing against the referee 's decision .
" The result is acceptable , " Scottish coach Craig Brown told reporters . "
We 'd hoped not to lose and we tried not to play for a draw but the Austrian defence was simply too good . "
SK Rapid 's Dietmar Kuehbauer , who gave an impressive performance , said the team started off well but let the game slip after the first <number> minutes .
" Somehow it seemed there were less than <number> players on the pitch .
We have lost two points .
The Scots are not really a great team and we should have won , " he said .

SOCCER - FRANCE LAUNCH <number> WORLD CUP BUILD-UP WITH <number> WIN .
PARIS <number>
Euro <number> absentee Nicolas Ouedec and Youri Djorkaeff scored the goals as <number> World Cup hosts France beat Mexico <number> in a friendly international on Saturday .
The victory extended to <number> matches France 's unbeaten run under coach Aime Jacquet , their Euro <number> semifinal elimination having come in a penalty shoot-out , but was marred by the sending-off of Chelsea central defender Franck Leboeuf .
Leboeuf was dismissed two minutes from time for a second bookable offence , fouling Mexican substitute Ricardo Pelaez who minutes earlier had also been shown the yellow card for pushing the Chelsea defender in the back .
Both goals came early in the second half after France had surprised the Mexicans with three half-time substitutions .
After a sterile first half , France injected more sting in midfield with the introduction of Juventus 's Zinedine Zidane .
This allowed Djorkaeff to play further up and his cross from the right fell for Ouedec , who has joined Espanyol of Barcelona from Nantes since missing the European championship finals through injury , to score after a mistake by midfielder Joaquin del Olmo .
Within four minutes Ouedec was returning the compliment for Djorkaeff , playing a one-two with the Internazionale Milan forward down the middle to set him up for a cross shot past diving goalkeeper Osvaldo Sanchez .

SOCCER - BELGIUM SCRAPE PAST TURKEY DESPITE CROWD TROUBLE .
Bert Lauwers
BRUSSELS <number>
Belgium kicked off their <number> World Cup campaign with a hard-fought <number> victory over <number> Turkey in a tense match marred by Turkish crowd trouble shortly after the break .
Turkish fans , upset at their team 's <number> first-half deficit , ripped apart dozens of plastic seats and threw them over the fence .
Riot police took <number> minutes to restore order .
The police were given an unexpected hand by second-half substitute Sergen Yalcin who rekindled Turkish hopes in the <number> with a splendid half-volley which stunned Belgian goalkeeper Filip De Wilde .
But Yalcin , who had come on just four minutes earlier , turned from hero to villain barely two minutes after his strike when he was sent off after spitting at an opponent and arguing with English referee David Elleray .
Marc Degryse had opened the scoring for Belgium after <number> minutes , whacking a low <number> drive into the net after an incisive pass by defender Dirk Medved from the edge of the penalty area .
Brazilian-born Luis Oliveira then gleefully slipped the ball past goalkeeper Rustu Recber from the right of the area to make it <number> seven minutes before the interval , Turkey 's best first-half effort proving to be a vicious <number> shot by Ogun Temizkanoglu which De Wilde tipped over .
The visitors , seeking to restore some pride after failing to score a single goal in Euro <number> in June , repeatedly ripped through the left side of the home defence but De Wilde was able to block several sharply-angled efforts .
With only the group seven winners qualifying automatically for the <number> finals in France , Belgium could not afford a slip-up at home and they frantically chased a decisive third goal .
But they were almost upset <number> minutes from time when De Wilde fumbled a hard Arif Erdem shot and Orhan Cikirikci almost pounced on the loose ball .
Belgium 's best second-half effort came three minutes later when Degryse put the ball over the bar from close range with Recber beaten .
Teams :
Belgium - <number> - Filip De Wilde , <number> - Bertrand Crasson , <number> - Dirk Medved , <number> - Pascal Renier , <number> - Geoffrey Claeys , <number> - Gunther Schepens ( <number> - Nico Van Kerckhoven , <number> ) , <number> - Enzo Scifo , <number> - Gert Verheyen ( <number> - Frederic Peiremans , <number> ) , <number> - Marc Degryse , <number> - Luc Nilis , <number> Luis Oliveira ( <number> - Gilles De Bilde , <number> ) .
Turkey - <number> - Rustu Recber , <number> - Hakan Unsal ( <number> - Sergen Yalcin , <number> ) , <number> - Recep Cetin , <number> - Ogun Temizkanoglu , <number> - Alpay Ozalan , <number> Abdullah Ercan , <number> - Tolunay Kafkas , <number> - Oguz Cetin ( <number> - Arif Erdem , <number> ) , <number> - Tayfun Korkut , <number> - Hakan Sukur , <number> - Saffet Sancakli ( <number> Orhan Cikirikci , <number> ) .
Belgian coach Wilfried Van Moer said he had not expected Turkey to be so strong and fast .
" We started panicking a bit after the Turkish goal ...
we suffered , " said Van Moer , who succeeded Paul Van Himst as coach in April .
It was Belgium 's first victory under Van Moer after two draws in friendlies against Russia and Italy .

Paper says Thatcher 's office consulted astrologer .
LONDON <number>
A British newspaper said Margaret Thatcher was so shaken by an IRA attempt on her life when she was prime minister in <number> that an astrologer was asked to warn her against future threats .
The Sunday Telegraph quoted Majorie Orr as saying she did a horoscope chart for Thatcher , a Libran , after she narrowly escaped death in the Irish guerrilla bombing of a hotel during the Conservative Party conference more than a decade ago .
Orr said Thatcher 's press secretary Bernard Ingram asked her to telephone if she saw any threatening indications in the future .
" Bernard Ingham told me that if I ever heard anything that indicated danger I was to let him know , " Orr said .
Orr said she never had to telephone .
She added that the horoscope was purely for security purposes and she was never consulted about political moves .
Ingram was quoted as telling the newspaper he thought astrology was " a load of rubbish " and that he could not recall asking Orr to keep a watch on Thatcher 's stars .
Thatcher , dubbed the " Iron Lady " for her driven , forceful personality , was never known to have an interest in the occult and in fact has a university degree in chemistry .
Former U.S. president Ronald Reagan 's wife , Nancy , admitted in her biography My Turn that she regularly consulted an astrologer to help her plan her husband 's schedule .

British Labour Party leader Tony Blair won a narrow victory on Saturday when the party 's Scottish executive voted <number> in favour of his plans for a referendum on a separate parliament for Scotland .
Blair once pledged to set up a Scottish parliament if the Labour won the next general election , which must be held by May <number> .
But many activists were dismayed when he abruptly decided earlier this year to hold a two-question referendum on the issue , asking Scots if they wanted a separate parliament and if it should have tax-raising powers .
Many party members argued that a general election win would demonstrate popular support for a separate parliament and others said a single question referendum would suffice .
Prime Minister John Major says the <number> union of the Scottish and English parliaments will be a main plank in his Conservative Party 's election platform .

S. African Afrikaners still seek own territory .
CAPE TOWN <number>
South African right-wing Afrikaners on Saturday revived their campaign for a form of self-rule , identifying a sparsely-populated area in Northern Cape province as the best place for a home of their own .
Constand Viljoen , leader of the Freedom Front party , told a news conference in Pretoria self-determination for Afrikaners could begin at local government level .
" Certain powers can be delegated from the provincial level , towards the sub-regions , " he said .
" We think that the Afrikaner model within this new , multi- ethnic society of South Africa will have to develop experimentally with world thinking in this regard . "
Viljoen broke with other right-wing whites in <number> by taking part in the country 's first all-race elections in April of that year , saying the only way to attain self-determination was by cooperating with President Nelson Mandela 's majority African National Congress .
Some right-wingers demanded sovereignty in their own territory in the run-up to the elections , saying the alternative was war .
Their threats came to nothing .
Viljoen has hailed clauses in South Africa 's new constitution as making possible a form of self-rule for the Afrikaners , descendants of the country 's Dutch , German and French settlers .
According to state television , Viljoen told the news conference the self-rule model should be introduced in parts of the Northern Cape provinces where a majority of people -- whites and mixed-race Coloureds -- speak Afrikaans .

Rwandan refugee group calls for calm over census .
NAIROBI <number>
A Rwandan refugee lobby group called on Saturday for calm in refugee camps in eastern Zaire during a census from Sunday to be conducted by aid workers .
The Rally for the Return of Refugees and Democracy in Rwanda ( RDR ) urged the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to avoid any " policing approach " and to calm refugees by explaining the aims of the operation .
" The RDR appeals to all refugees to prepare themselves calmly for the demands of the census agents because it will be in their ultimate interest , " the group said in a statement .
It said refugees feared census takers would use indelible ink to mark them so they could be detected by Rwandan government troops and mistreated if they were forced back into Rwanda .
U.N. officials said more than <number> aid workers will take part in the census from Sunday until Tuesday of the estimated <number> refugees in camps around the eastern Zairean border town of Goma .
Only about <number> refugees a week are returning voluntarily to Rwanda in contrast to the <number> babies born in the camps weekly .
Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo said at the end of a visit to Rwanda last week that the Zairean and Rwandan governments agreed on an " organised , massive and unconditional repatriation " of the <number> million Rwandan refugees in Zaire .
He said the repatriation would be carried out swiftly and would be enormous , starting with the closure of refugee camps .
RDR said it feared forced expulsions would start in days .
Zairean troops expelled <number> refugees in August last year .
Many of the <number> million Rwandan Hutu refugees in Zaire and nearly <number> in Tanzania refuse to go home , saying they fear reprisals for the <number> genocide in Rwanda of up to a million people by Hutus .

Chechens exuberant but cautious on peace deal .
Liutauras Stremaitis
URUS-MARTAN , Russia <number>
Crowds of pro-independence Chechens greeted a newly-signed peace deal by singing , dancing and firing guns in the air on Saturday , but the celebrations held a trace of uncertainty .
More than a thousand women , children and men gathered in a field to the north of the town of Urus-Martan on Saturday to wait for a column of rebels to withdraw from the capital Grozny about <number> km ( <number> miles ) away .
The men fired weapons into the air as groups of women danced .
Adults in the crowd carried posters of former Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev -- who declared independence in <number> -- and children , carrying photographs of him , called " Troops out ! "
.
Russian military officials have expressed fears that the rebels and their supporters will see the deal signed by Russian peace envoy Alexander Lebed in the early hours of Saturday as a military victory for the separatists .
It involves the withdrawal of Russian troops sent to Chechnya in December <number> to crush the separatists and a postponement of the issue at the heart of the conflict -- the status of the mainly-Moslem North Caucasus region .
But the people in the crowd on Saturday , who had turned out in support of the rebels , did not seem sure that the war was over .
" We hope for the best , that it really has ended so we can live in peace .
It 's our only dream , " said a <number> woman , Mubatik Dagayeva .
Aiza Dudayeva , with her <number> son beside her , shared the guarded optimism . "
We really want the war to end , we hope and believe that our sons and brothers will win , " said Dudayeva , adding that she was from Urus-Martan .
Urus-Martan is a traditionally anti-separatist pocket in Chechnya and Moscow-backed leader Doku Zavgayev , who has been sidelined in the peace deal , has warned that it and places like it could become centres of civil war if Russian troops leave .
But on Saturday the people gathered just outside the town seemed to be united in favour of the separatists .
Two columns of rebels appeared in jeeps and cars , firing their guns in the air , as the crowd rushed towards them .
Mouldi Mamatuyev , in his late <number> 's , dressed in black and carrying a machine gun , was welcomed by his mother and sister .
" Two sons have come back , " said his mother Nurbika Mamatuyeva . "
It 's the end .
We believe in God . "
Mamatuyev joked that his sister Lisa was a rebel too , and she responded by grabbing hold of his gun and shouting the Chechen war cry " Allahu Akhbar " ( God is Greatest ) and " Freedom for Chechnya ! "
.
The fighter , sitting next to a man dressed in green and carrying a grenade-launcher , said that the strict Islamic law adopted by the rebels during the conflict was now needed to impose peace .
" The war has ended if everything works out , if there is law there will be power .
Only Sheriat ( Islamic law ) can end the war . "

Polish group to bid for Ruch newsstand chain - paper .
WARSAW <number>
A Polish consortium including the Bank Rozwoju Exportu SA ( BRE ) plans to rival France 's Hachette in bidding for Polish state-owned press distribution chain Ruch SA , Zycie Warszawy daily said on Saturday .
Zycie Warszawy said its own publisher , mineral water firm Multico , and a group headed by Polish businessman Zygmunt Solorz were forming a consortium which would offer about $ <number> million , with finance provided by BRE .
The consortium wanted <number> percent of Ruch 's shares , the state would get <number> percent of Ruch and <number> percent would be offered on the Warsaw stock exchange .
" This division would guarantee a dispersal of capital , preventing anyone from taking total control over Ruch and dictating market conditions , " the paper quoted one of the initiators of the move as saying , without giving a name .
A consortium of press distributor Hachette and Polish publishers group UWP are seeking more than than <number> percent of Ruch and French President Jacques Chirac is likely to support its case when he visits Poland in September , the daily said .
News-stand chain Ruch , which controls about <number> percent of Poland 's press distribution market , had a net profit of <number> million zlotys on sales of <number> billion zlotys in <number> .
It has about <number> news-stands and was the country 's sole press distributor before the <number> fall of communism .
Zycie Warszawy said the new , open consortium , which also included several listed Polish firms , would on Monday inform Privatisation Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek of its plans .
It aims to invest $ <number> million in Ruch over five years -- more than the sum Ruch says it needs to upgrade its outlets .
Initially Poland offered up to <number> percent of Ruch but in March Kaczmarek cancelled the tender and offered a minority stake with an option to increase the equity .
Two consortia -- UWP-Hachette and a consortium of a Polish SPC group and Swiss firms -- placed initial bids .
But after the change of tender conditions Swiss investors pulled out and SPC decided to bid jointly with UWP-Hachette .
Kaczmarek said in May he was unhappy that only one investor ended up bidding for Ruch , in which the government was initially offering up to <number> percent of shares with an option to extend the holding after investment promises are fulfilled .

China said to fear dissidents more than criminals .
MANILA <number>
The detention of veteran dissident Wang Donghai showed China 's determination to crush any vestige of dissent during the current profound transitions in the nation 's leadership , a human rights activist said on Saturday .
Xiao Qiang , executive director of the New York-based group Human Rights in China , said Wang 's arrest on Friday appeared to be part of the national " Strike Hard " campaign that has imprisoned thousands and sent hundreds to their death .
Although supposedly aimed at criminals , dozens of human rights activists have been detained in the campaign , which is meant to strengthen the Communist Party 's grip on power as senior leader Deng Xiaoping nears death , Xiao said in an interview .
" China is going through this power transition period .
The authorities are apparently extremely afraid of any political and social discontent , " said Xiao , in Manila to attend an Amnesty International conference on human rights in China .
He said one of Wang 's apparent offences was to write a public letter in May suggesting that a free press and an independent judicial system were vital if the government really meant to stamp out rampant corruption .
Xiao said crushing legitimate dissent was only making the problem worse and one day China would pay a high price .
" Those issues are not going to go away by repression .
You only make things more hidden but potentially more explosive , " he said .
Wang was arrested in the east China city of Hangzhou by security officers who told the dissident 's family he would be sent to a study class -- a euphemism for coercive ideological reform .
Wang , <number> , was sentenced last month to one year 's " re-education by labour " but was released because of ill-health .
Xiao said conditions in the labour camp were so brutal they drove another activist sentenced with Wang to attempt suicide .
Police beat Wang and his colleague , Chen Longde , and encouraged other camp inmates to attack them as well , Xiao said .

Burma 's Suu Kyi says military rulers abuse law .
Deborah Charles
RANGOON <number>
Burma 's democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi hit out at the government on Saturday for recent arrests and jailing of activists , saying the military abused the law to try to crush the democracy movement .
" The main purpose of this press conference is to make it known to the world that the authorities are misusing the law all the time in order to try to crush the democracy movement , " Suu Kyi told reporters at her Rangoon home .
Suu Kyi said at least <number> democracy supporters had been arrested since May , and about <number> of them had been sentenced , most to long prison terms .
In May the government launched a sweeping crackdown on the democracy movement , detaining over <number> members of Suu Kyi 's National League for Democracy ( NLD ) ahead of a party congress .
Most were released but several dozen remain in custody .
The Burmese government last week confirmed the recent sentencing of nine democracy activists who were arrested in the May crackdown , including Suu Kyi 's assistant Win Htein .
The military government , which in May said it had detained the politicians to prevent anarchy , said the activists were charged with attempting to destroy the peace and stability of the state .
But Suu Kyi disagreed with the methods , saying officials often arrested NLD supporters in the middle of the night , then did not give them the opportunity to defend themselves in trials .
" When our people are tried , they are tried in a very secretive way .
Their families are not told , " she said .
Suu Kyi , who spearheads a campaign for sanctions on Burma 's government , was under house arrest for six years without being tried before being released in July <number> .
Several other leading members of the NLD have served prison terms .
The NLD party won a landslide victory in a <number> election but the State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) , which assumed power in <number> after crushing pro-democracy demonstrations , never recognised the poll .
" This lack of rule of law is an indication that the authorities are not interested in fair play , " she said . "
They are using a travesty of the law to try and crush our movements and to sentence our people to long terms in prison without proper trial . "
Suu Kyi said once the activists were sentenced , they suffered inhuman conditions and lack of rights in prison .
" Almost all of the prisoners start suffering from various health problems after a couple of years in jail , " she said . "
Some of our people have been in prison for five to six years . "
Most political prisoners are held in Rangoon 's Insein Prison .
Some who have been released have recounted torture methods like sleep and food deprivation and physical abuse .
" If there are any more instances of death in custody it will be further proof that a prison sentence for political prisoners is sometimes almost the same as a death sentence , " Suu Kyi said .
Hla Than , an elected member of parliament for the NLD , died in early August after being at Insein for six years .
His death came five weeks after James Leander ( Leo ) Nichols , a close friend of Suu Kyi and Danish honorary consul , died while serving a prison term at Insein .
Suu Kyi said the government had increased its repression tactics on the democracy movement because it feared the growing popularity of the movement .
But she said she and the NLD would not stop their efforts to bring democracy to Burma even if it meant more arrests of party members or even herself .
" We will carry on .
Nobody is free from arrest in Burma . "

Automakers , suppliers , insurers and the federal government 's auto safety agency Saturday launched a $ <number> million safety awareness campaign aimed at reducing the number of children killed accidentally by air bags in cars and trucks .
Officials said they will work with law enforcement agencies , pediatricians and media to warn parents about the dangers that air bags pose to children and adults not wearing seatbelts .
Since <number> , <number> children have been killed by the explosive force of automotive air bags , which inflate at speeds up to <number> miles per hour .
The first portion of the campaign involves pickup trucks equipped with billboards that were driving along some of the nation 's busiest interstate highways during the Labor Day weekend , including Interstate <number> on the East Coast , Interstates <number> and <number> in the Midwest and Interstate <number> in California .
The boards read : " Air Bag Safety : Everyone Buckled , Kids in Back . "
Janet Dewey , executive director of the industry-funded National Automobile Occupant Protection Campaign , said most of the injuries to children occurred because they were not wearing seatbelts .
A child 's chances of being killed in a car accident , whether the vehicle was equipped with an air bag or not , is reduced by <number> percent when they are in the rear seat , she said .
The auto industry was about three to six years away from introducing " smart " air bags with the ability to detect the size and position of an occupant and adjust inflation pressures accordingly .
Current air bags were designed to halt the forward momentum of an average-sized , unbelted adult male , not a small child .
Automakers petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to allow them to introduce air bags that inflate less aggressively to help reduce unwanted injuries .
" Even if changes are made to airbags today , we 'd still have <number> million vehicles on the road with current technology , " Dewey said . "
The public has n't been getting the message . "

The film , starring Liam Neeson and Julia Roberts , recounts the life of Michael Collins , the Irish Republican Army 's Director of Intelligence who fought for Irish independence from <number> to <number> .
Although not due for release in Britain until early next year , some politicians have already said they feared it would fan sectarian tensions in British-ruled Northern Ireland .
Jordan defends his decision to make the film , whose screenplay he wrote himself after years of research , saying it was " more about history than any political statement " .
" The film spares neither the Irish nor the British in its depiction of the savagery of the time , " Jordan said in a statement released by Warner Bros . "
How often has independence been achieved without bloodshed ?
Very rarely . "
Jordan , whose <number> film " The Crying Game " also came under fire for what was perceived as a sympathetic portrayal of the IRA , said Collins was more than just a revolutionary .
" He developed techniques of guerilla warfare later copied by independence movements around the world , from Mao Tse-Tung in China to Yitzak Shamir in Israel , " Jordan said .
" Collins would never be a proponent of contemporary terrorism as practised today .
He was a soldier and a statesman and , over time , a man of peace . "
Leeson , the Northern Ireland-born actor who was nominated for an Oscar for best actor for his performance in " Schindler 's List " , plays the lead role in Jordan 's film .
Aidan Quinn portrays Harry Boland , Collins ' best friend , and rival for the love of Kitty Kiernan , played by Roberts .
Much of the film was shot on location in Dublin with Jordan using thousands of its citizens as unpaid extras .
A set , however , was used for the fighting scenes .
Noting that information about Collins was " as mysterious as the existence he maintained " , Jordan said he made some historical assumptions in the film .
" I have made choices about certain events based on my own extensive research into his letters and reported speeches , " he said . "
I wanted to make this a story as accurate as possible without killing it dramatically and I think I have .
It is a very true film . "
One of the assumptions is his interpretation of the murky circumstances surrounding the shooting death of Collins , who had broken with his comrades when he sought a negotiated settlement with Britain , in an ambush in <number> .
" I have never lost more sleep over the making of a film than I have over ' Michael Collins ' , but I 'll never make a more important one , " Jordan said .
" In the life of one person you can tell the events that formed the north and south of Ireland as they are today . "
