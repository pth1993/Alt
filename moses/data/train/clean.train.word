EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb .
Peter Blackburn
BRUSSELS <number>
The European Commission said on Thursday it disagreed with German advice to consumers to shun British lamb until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to sheep .
Germany 's representative to the European Union 's veterinary committee Werner Zwingmann said on Wednesday consumers should buy sheepmeat from countries other than Britain until the scientific advice was clearer .
" We do n't support any such recommendation because we do n't see any grounds for it , " the Commission 's chief spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas told a news briefing .
He said further scientific study was required and if it was found that action was needed it should be taken by the European Union .
He said a proposal last month by EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler to ban sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains was a highly specific and precautionary move to protect human health .
Fischler proposed EU-wide measures after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- mad cow disease .
But Fischler agreed to review his proposal after the EU 's standing veterinary committee , mational animal health officials , questioned if such action was justified as there was only a slight risk to human health .
Spanish Farm Minister Loyola de Palacio had earlier accused Fischler at an EU farm ministers ' meeting of causing unjustified alarm through " dangerous generalisation . "
.
Only France and Britain backed Fischler 's proposal .
The EU 's scientific veterinary and multidisciplinary committees are due to re-examine the issue early next month and make recommendations to the senior veterinary officials .
Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a brain-wasting disease similar to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste .
British farmers denied on Thursday there was any danger to human health from their sheep , but expressed concern that German government advice to consumers to avoid British lamb might influence consumers across Europe .
" What we have to be extremely careful of is how other countries are going to take Germany 's lead , " Welsh National Farmers ' Union ( NFU ) chairman John Lloyd Jones said on BBC radio .
Bonn has led efforts to protect public health after consumer confidence collapsed in March after a British report suggested humans could contract an illness similar to mad cow disease by eating contaminated beef .
Germany imported <number> sheep from Britain last year , nearly half of total imports .
It brought in <number> tonnes of British mutton , some <number> percent of overall imports .

China says Taiwan spoils atmosphere for talks .
BEIJING <number>
China on Thursday accused Taipei of spoiling the atmosphere for a resumption of talks across the Taiwan Strait with a visit to Ukraine by Taiwanese Vice President Lien Chan this week that infuriated Beijing .
Speaking only hours after Chinese state media said the time was right to engage in political talks with Taiwan , Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told Reuters : " The necessary atmosphere for the opening of the talks has been disrupted by the Taiwan authorities . "
State media quoted China 's top negotiator with Taipei , Tang Shubei , as telling a visiting group from Taiwan on Wednesday that it was time for the rivals to hold political talks .
" Now is the time for the two sides to engage in political talks ...
that is to end the state of hostility , " Thursday 's overseas edition of the People 's Daily quoted Tang as saying .

Israel plays down fears of war with Syria .
Colleen Siegel
JERUSALEM <number>
Israel 's outgoing peace negotiator with Syria said on Thursday current tensions between the two countries appeared to be a storm in a teacup .
Itamar Rabinovich , who as Israel 's ambassador to Washington conducted unfruitful negotiations with Syria , told Israel Radio it looked like Damascus wanted to talk rather than fight .
" It appears to me the Syrian priority is still to negotiate .
The Syrians are confused , they are definitely tense , but the general assessment here in Washington is that this is essentially a storm in a teacup , " he said .
Rabinovich is winding up his term as ambassador .
He will be replaced by Eliahu Ben-Elissar , a former Israeli envoy to Egypt and right-wing Likud party politician .
Israel on Wednesday sent Syria a message , via Washington , saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions .
But it slammed Damascus for creating what it called a dangerous atmosphere .
Syria accused Israel on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israeli television reported that Damascus had recently test fired a missile .
It said its arms purchases were for defensive purposes .
" The message that we sent to ( Syrian President Hafez al- ) Assad is that Israel is ready at any time without preconditions to enter peace negotiations , " Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel Radio in an interview .
Tension has mounted since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June vowing to retain the Golan Heights Israel captured from Syria in the <number> Middle East war .
Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked over the Golan since <number> despite the previous government 's willingness to make Golan concessions .
Peace talks between the two sides were last held in February .
" The voices coming out of Damascus are bad , not good .
The media ...
are full of expressions and declarations that must be worrying ...
this artificial atmosphere is very dangerous because those who spread it could become its prisoners , " Levy said .
" We expect from Syria , if its face is to peace , that it will answer Israel 's message to enter peace negotiations because that is our goal , " he said . "
We do not want a war , God forbid .
No one benefits from wars . "
Israel 's Channel Two television said Damascus had sent a " calming signal " to Israel .
It gave no source for the report .
Netanyahu and Levy 's spokesmen said they could not confirm it .
The television also said that Netanyahu had sent messages to reassure Syria via Cairo , the United States and Moscow .

An Iranian exile group based in Iraq vowed on Thursday to extend support to Iran 's Kurdish rebels after they were attacked by Iranian troops deep inside Iraq last month .
A Mujahideen Khalq statement said its leader Massoud Rajavi met in Baghdad the Secretary-General of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran ( KDPI ) Hassan Rastegar on Wednesday and voiced his support to Iran 's rebel Kurds .
" Rajavi emphasised that the Iranian Resistance would continue to stand side by side with their Kurdish compatriots and the resistance movement in Iranian Kurdistan , " it said .
A spokesman for the group said the meeting " signals a new level of cooperation between Mujahideen Khalq and the Iranian Kurdish oppositions " .
Iran heavily bombarded targets in northern Iraq in July in pursuit of KDPI guerrillas based in Iraqi Kurdish areas outside the control of the government in Baghdad .
Iraqi Kurdish areas bordering Iran are under the control of guerrillas of the Iraqi Kurdish Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) group .
PUK and Iraq 's Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) the two main Iraqi Kurdish factions , have had northern Iraq under their control since Iraqi forces were ousted from Kuwait in the <number> Gulf War .
Clashes between the two parties broke out at the weekend in the most serious fighting since a U.S.-sponsored ceasefire last year .

Israel approves Arafat 's flight to West Bank .
JERUSALEM <number>
Israel gave Palestinian President Yasser Arafat permission on Thursday to fly over its territory to the West Bank , ending a brief Israeli-PLO crisis , an Arafat adviser said .
" The problem is over .
The president 's aircraft has received permission to pass through Israeli airspace but the president is not expected to travel to the West Bank before Monday , " Nabil Abu Rdainah told Reuters .
Arafat had been scheduled to meet former Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres in the West Bank town of Ramallah on Thursday but the venue was changed to Gaza after Israel denied flight clearance to the Palestinian leader 's helicopters .
Palestinian officials accused right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of trying to stop the Ramallah meeting by keeping Arafat grounded .
Arafat subsequently cancelled a meeting between Israeli and PLO officials , on civilian affairs , at the Allenby Bridge crossing between Jordan and the West Bank .
Abu Rdainah said Arafat had decided against flying to the West Bank on Thursday , after Israel lifted the ban , because he had a busy schedule in Gaza and would not be free until Monday .

Three Afghan guards brought to the United Arab Emirates last week by Russian hostages who escaped from the Taleban militia will return to Afghanistan in a few days , the Afghan embassy in Abu Dhabi said on Thursday .
" Our ambassador is in touch with the UAE foreign ministry .
Their return to Afghanistan will take place in two or three days , " an embassy official said .
" The embassy is issuing them travel documents for their return to their homeland .
There is no objection to their travel , " he added .
The three Islamic Taleban guards were overpowered by seven Russian aircrew who escaped to UAE state Sharjah last Friday on board their own aircraft after a year in the captivity of Taleban militia in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan .
The UAE said on Monday it would hand over the three to the International Red Crescent , possibly last Tuesday .
It has since been silent on the issue .
When asked whether the three guards would travel back to Kandahar or the Afghan capital Kabul , the embassy official said : " That has not been decided , but possibly Kandahar . "
Kandahar is the headquarters of the opposition Taleban militia .
Kabul is controlled by President Burhanuddin Rabbani 's government , which Taleban is fighting to overthrow .
The embassy official said the three men , believed to be in their <number> , were currently in Abu Dhabi .
He did not elaborate .
The Russians , working for the Aerostan firm in the Russian republic of Tatarstan , were taken hostage after a Taleban <number> fighter forced their cargo plane to land in August <number> .
Taleban said its shipment of ammunition from Albania was evidence of Russian military support for Rabbani 's government .
Moscow said the crew 's nationality was coincidental .
Numerous diplomatic attempts to free the seven failed .
The Russians , who said they overpowered the guards -- two armed with Kalashnikov automatic rifles -- while doing regular maintenance work on their Ilyushin <number> cargo plane last Friday , left the UAE capital Abu Dhabi for home on Sunday .

German farm ministry tells consumers to avoid British mutton .
BONN <number>
Germany 's Agriculture Ministry suggested on Wednesday that consumers avoid eating meat from British sheep until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to the animals .
" Until this is cleared up by the European Union 's scientific panels -- and we have asked this to be done as quickly as possible -- ( consumers ) should if at all possible give preference to sheepmeat from other countries , " ministry official Werner Zwingmann told ZDF television .
" I do not want to say that there is a concrete danger for consumers , " he added . "
There are too many holes in what we know , and these must be filled very quickly . "
Bonn has led efforts to ensure consumer protection tops the list of priorities in dealing with the mad cow crisis , which erupted in March when Britain acknowledged humans could contract a similar illness by eating contaminated beef .
The European Commission agreed this month to rethink a proposal to ban the use of suspect sheep tissue after some EU veterinary experts questioned whether it was justified .
EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler had proposed banning sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- mad cow disease .
But some members of the EU 's standing veterinary committee questioned whether the action was necessary given the slight risk to human health .
The question is being studied separately by two EU scientific committees .
Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a similar brain-wasting disease to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste .
British officials say sheep meat is perfectly safe to eat .
ZDF said Germany imported <number> sheep from Britain last year , nearly half of total imports .
It brought in <number> tonnes of British mutton , some <number> percent of overall imports .
After the British government admitted a possible link between mad cow disease and its fatal human equivalent , the EU imposed a worldwide ban on British beef exports .
EU leaders agreed at a summit in June to a progressive lifting of the ban as Britain takes parallel measures to eradicate the disease .

TENNIS - NEWCOMBE PONDERS HIS DAVIS CUP FUTURE .
SYDNEY <number>
Australian Davis Cup captain John Newcombe on Thursday signalled his possible resignation if his team loses an away tie against Croatia next month .

Australia face Croatia in the world group qualifying tie on clay from September <number> .
Under Newcombe 's leadership , Australia were relegated from the elite world group last year , the first time the <number> Davis Cup winners had slipped from the top rank .
Since taking over as captain from Neale Fraser in <number> , Newcombe 's record in tandem with Roche , his former doubles partner , has been three wins and three losses .
Newcombe has selected Wimbledon semifinalist Jason Stoltenberg , Patrick Rafter , Mark Philippoussis , and Olympic doubles champions Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde to face the Croatians .
The home side boasts world number six Goran Ivanisevic , and Newcombe conceded his players would be hard-pressed to beat the Croatian number one .
" We are ready to fight to our last breath -- Australia must play at its absolute best to win , " said Newcombe , who described the tie as the toughest he has faced as captain .

Garlic pills do n't lower cholesterol , study finds .

Garlic pills may not lower blood cholesterol and studies that show they do may be flawed , British researchers have reported .
A study by a team of doctors at Oxford University has found people with high blood cholesterol do not benefit significantly from taking garlic tablets .
The study involved <number> people with high blood cholesterol levels .
They were given <number> milligrams a day of dried garlic powder or placebo tablets . "
There were no significant differences between the groups receiving garlic and placebo , " they wrote in the Journal of the Royal College of Physicians .
Those taking part were told to eat a low-fat diet for six weeks before they started taking the pills , and their blood cholesterol measured before and after the six-week period .
The researchers said this would make their findings more accurate .
Several studies have found garlic pills can lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol .
But the Oxford team disputed these findings and said either previous trials may have been interpreted incorrectly , those taking part were not given special diets beforehand or the duration of the studies may have been too short .
The six-month trial was funded by the British Heart Foundation and Lichtwer Pharma GmbH , which makes Kwai brand garlic tablets .
The study did not address whether whole garlic could affect cholesterol .

Tennis - Philippoussis looms for Sampras in U.S. Open .
Bill Berkrot
NEW YORK <number>
World number one Pete Sampras , seeking his first Grand Slam title of the year , and women 's top seed Steffi Graf , aiming for her third , should be able to ease into the year 's final major , which begins on Monday .
Sampras opens the defence of his U.S. Open crown against David Rikl of the Czech Republic , while top-ranked Graf begins her title defence against Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia .
Wednesday 's U.S. Open draw ceremony revealed that both title holders should run into their first serious opposition in the third round .
Looming in Sampras 's future is a likely third-round date with recent nemesis Mark Philippoussis , the rising Australian who took out Sampras in the third round of the Australian Open in January .
Sampras avenged that defeat with a straight sets win over the <number> power hitter in the second round at Wimbledon and their rubber match in New York could provide some first-week fireworks .
While only a stunning upset will keep Graf from sailing through to a predictable semifinal showdown with third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario , the German star could also be tested in the third round where she will probably face <number> veteran Natasha Zvereva of Belarus .
There will be no repeat of last year 's men 's final with eighth-ranked Andre Agassi landing in Sampras 's half of the draw .
Bumping Agassi up to the sixth seeding avoided the possibility that he would run into Sampras as early as the quarter-finals , but they could lock horns in the semis .
Olympic champion Agassi meets Karim Alami of Morocco in the first round .
Surprise second seed Michael Chang , ranked third in the world , opens against Czech Daniel Vacek , while women 's second seed Monica Seles drew American Anne Miller as her first victim .
Second-ranked Austrian Thomas Muster , who was seeded third , did not have the luck of the draw with him .
In the first round Muster faces American Richey Reneberg , who has been playing some of the best tennis of his career of late .
If he survives , Muster is seeded to run into either fifth-seeded Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands or <number> American Todd Martin in the quarter-finals in Chang 's half of the draw .
Perhaps the best , yet most unfortunate , first-round matchup of the men 's competition pits eighth seed Jim Courier against retiring star Stefan Edberg .
The popular Swede is playing his final major tournament next week and the two-time champion 's Grand Slam farewell could well be a one-match affair .
With the exception of a Philippoussis showdown , Sampras looks to have landed in a comfortable quarter of the draw with the likes of Frenchman Cedric Pioline and ailing French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov , who is nursing a rib injury , in his path .
Seles , runner-up to Graf last year , is seeded to run into fifth-ranked German Anke Huber in the quarter-finals with fourth seed Conchita Martinez or eighth-seeded Olympic champion Lindsay Davenport looking like her most likely semifinal opponents .
But Huber will be tested immediately with a first-round encounter against dangerous <number> South African Amanda Coetzer .
Sanchez Vicario , runner-up to Graf at the French Open and Wimbledon , begins play against a qualifier in a quarter of the draw that includes young talent Martina Hingis , the <number> seed , before a probable quarter-final clash with seventh-seeded veteran Jana Novotna .
Martinez begins play against Ruxandra Dragomir of Romania .

Top-seeded Thomas Muster of Austria was beaten <number> <number> by <number> Daniel Nestor of Canada on Wednesday in his first match of the $ <number> million Canadian Open .
A lefthander with a strong serve , Nestor kept the rallies short by constantly attacking the net and the tactic worked in the second-round match against Muster , playing his first match after receiving a first-round bye along with the other top eight seeds .
The tournament also lost its second seed on the third day of play when second-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia was beaten <number> ) <number> <number> by unseeded Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden .
Other seeded players advancing were number three Wayne Ferreira of South Africa , number four Marcelo Rios of Chile , number six MaliVai Washington of the United States and American Todd Martin , the seventh seeed .

Philippoussis saved a match point at <number> in the third-set tie break before winning <number> <number> <number> ( <number> ) .
Philippoussis 's compatriot , <number> seed Jason Stoltenberg , was not as fortunate .
He held one match point at <number> in a marathon third-set tie break but was beaten <number> <number> ( <number> ) <number> ( <number> ) by unseeded Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic .
" I knew I had to serve well and keep the points short and that 's what I was able to do , " said Nestor , who ranks <number> in doubles .
There were only two service breaks in the match .
The lanky Canadian broke Muster at <number> in the first set and <number> in the second before ending the match on his third match point when the Austrian hit a service return long .
" I probably did n't hit five ground strokes in the whole match , " said Muster , only partly joking . "
The way he was chipping and charging and serving and volleying I did n't really get my timing playing from the baseline . "
" He played a good match , took a few chances , and every time he was down he was able to come up with a big first serve . "
Playing at night was not Muster 's preference . "
I asked for a day match and they gave me a night match , " he said . "
I do n't like playing under the lights but maybe it would not have made any difference . "
Ivanisevic rallied from a <number> deficit in the first set but then played erratically against the <number> Tillstrom , who was a surprise winner over his famous compatriot Stefan Edberg in the second round at Wimbledon .
Ivanisevic hit <number> aces but was outplayed from the back court by the <number> Tillstrom .
The sixth-ranked Ivanisevic , who lost in the final at Indianapolis to world number one Pete Sampras of the U.S. last Sunday , made a quick getaway after his loss but did say : " Something was not there when I arrived ( in Toronto ) .
I did n't feel good .
And I did n't have a good feeling as soon as I lost in my doubles ( on Tuesday ) . "
" I thought he looked a little unfocused at certain times on his ground strokes , " said Tillstrom .
The <number> Philippoussis , who beat Sampras in the third round of this year 's Australian Open , stayed calm in a nervy third-set tie break against Rosset .
" I 'm pleased because I did n't play that great today , but I fought really well , " he said . "
When I was down <number> in the tiebreak ( in the third set ) , I just thought about winning my two serves and hoped that he might get tight .
Then he shanked a forehand at to make it <number> and that helped me back . "

Palestinians accuse PA of banning books .
NABLUS , West Bank <number>
A West Bank bookseller charged on Thursday that the Palestinian Information Ministry has forced him to sign an undertaking not to distribute books written by critics of Israeli-PLO self-rule deals .
" They made me sign an undertaking not to sell the books to anyone at the risk of legal action .
One official told me ' you have to either destroy the books or return them to Amman ' , " Daoud Makkawi , owner of the Nablus-based al-Risala bookshop , told Reuters .
He said ministry officials made him sign this a few weeks ago after he brought about a dozen copies from Jordan of a book by Edward Said , a prominent scholar at New York City 's Columbia University .
Said , a U.S. citizen of Palestinian origin , has been an outspoken critic of the <number> Israeli-PLO self-rule deal and has written at least two books on the accord .
On Wednesday a bookseller in the West Bank town of Ramallah said police about a month ago confiscated several copies of two of Said 's books on the Israel-PLO self-rule deals .
Palestinian Information Ministry Director-General Mutawakel Taha denied that ministry officials forced anyone to sign any undertaking and insisted that the Palestinian Authority has no plans to censor books .
" There is no strategy to ban books or to suppress freedom of expression in any form whatsoever , " Taha told Reuters .
But Taha said that the absence of relevent legislations may have resulted in some mistakes by some security officials .
" This may explain some mistakes against some journalists and writers , " he said .
Daoud said books by other authors , including British Journalist Patrick Seale , were also banned .
He said that security officials often visit his shop to make sure he was not selling the books .

If we have confidence , why should we be afraid of the other opinion ? "

Egypt wants nothing to do with Sudanese rulers .
CAIRO <number>
The Egyptian government will have nothing more to do with the Sudanese government because it continues to shelter and support Egyptian militants , President Hosni Mubarak said in a speech on Thursday .
Egypt says the Sudanese government helped the Moslem militants who tried to kill Mubarak in Addis Ababa last year .
It sponsored last week 's U.N. Security Council resolution threatening a ban on Sudanese flights abroad if Khartoum does not hand over three men accused in the Addis Ababa incident .
The sanctions will come into effect in November if Sudan fails to extradite the men , but Sudan says it cannot hand them over to Ethiopia for trial because they are not in Sudan .
" We are still eager that nothing should affect the Sudanese people but we will not deal with the current regime or the Turabi front or whatever , " Mubarak told a group of academics .
Hassan al-Turabi is the leader of the National Islamic Front , the political force behind the Sudanese government .
" I do n't want to go into more details than that but there are more details and they are bitter .
There are terrorists they are sheltering and they make Sudanese passorts for them and they get paid by them , " Mubarak said .
He did not say if Egypt would go so far as to break relations , a step it has been reluctant to take , ostensibly because it would affect ordinary Sudanese .

Miss Universe , Venezuela 's Alicia Machado , left New Mexico on Thursday , refusing to answer questions about her weight or claims she was told to either go on a crash diet or give up her title .
Machado , <number> , flew to Los Angeles after slipping away from the New Mexico desert town of Las Cruces , where she attended the <number> Miss Teen USA pageant on Wednesday .
While Machado was not a contestant here , she came under intense scrutiny following reports she was given an ultimatum by Los Angeles-based Miss Universe Inc. to drop <number> pounds ( <number> kg ) in two weeks or risk losing her crown .
In Venezuela , her mother told Reuters that Machado had a swollen face when she left home two weeks ago because she had her wisdom teeth extracted .
Marta Fajardo insisted her daughter , who weighed <number> pounds ( <number> kg ) when she won the Miss Universe title in Las Vegas in May , had perfectly normal eating habits .
" Everybody has their own addiction to something or other but it 's not as if she eats cakes like crazy , " she said .
Organisers flatly denied ever threatening Machado but immediately put her under wraps and blocked access to her .
Dressed in a black strapless evening gown at Wednesday 's pageant , Machado was clearly heavier than the contestants but still won rave reviews after her brief appearance on stage .
" Are you kidding ?
She 's fantastic , " said Nikki Campbell , <number> , who went to the pageant . "
She looked great .
Very sexy . "
Machado 's publicists said on Thursday she was scheduled to stay in Los Angeles for promotional work with sponsors before returning to Venezuela on Sept .
<number> .
Beauty queens are high-profile personalities in Venezuela and Machado 's alleged weight problem made front page news this week .
It was an official of the Miss Venezuela Organisation who first said Machado had been told to lose weight fast .
People close to her said she then eased up on her diet and indulged her passion for pasta and cake , but it was not clear how many pounds she gained and most people who saw her said she was still a long way from being fat .
Martin Brooks , president of Miss Universe Inc , said he spoke with Machado to assure her that organisers were not putting pressure on her .
" She 's fine with it .
She wished , as we all did , that it had n't happened but she 's spiritually and mentally terrific .
There 's no problem whatsoever , " he told Reuters .
He said the lifestyle associated with being Miss Universe could make routine exercise difficult .
" The problem is they travel so much and are so busy that the ability to have any type of regimented routine workout does n't exist .
I dont know if Alicia is working out .
We have n't talked about it because it has n't been an issue , " he said .

Defiant U.S. neo-Nazi jailed by German court .
Andrew Gray
HAMBURG , Germany <number>
A Hamburg court sentenced U.S. neo-Nazi leader Gary Lauck on Thursday to four years in prison for pumping banned extremist propaganda into Germany from his base in the United States .
Lauck , from Lincoln , Nebraska , yelled a tirade of abuse at the court after his conviction for inciting racial hatred .
" The struggle will go on , " the <number> shouted in German before being escorted out by security guards .
Lauck 's lawyer vowed he would appeal against the court 's decision , arguing that his client should have been set free because he had not committed any offence under German law .
The German government hailed the conviction as a major victory in the fight against neo-Nazism .
Lauck 's worldwide network has been the main source of anti-Semitic propaganda material flowing into Germany since the <number> .
" Lauck possessed a well-oiled propaganda machine , honed during more than <number> years , " presiding judge Guenter Bertram told the court .
" He set up a propaganda cannon and fired it at Germany . "
said Bertram , who also read out extracts from Lauck 's material praising Hitler as " the greatest of all leaders " and describing the Nazi slaughter of millions of Jews as a myth .
Eager to put Lauck behind bars quickly and avoid a long and complex trial , prosecutor Bernd Mauruschat limited his charges to offences since <number> .
He had demanded a five-year jail term but said he was satisfied with the court 's sentence .
Publishing and distributing neo-Nazi material is illegal in Germany but Lauck 's defence team had argued that U.S freedom of speech laws meant he was free to produce his swastika-covered books , magazines , videos and flags in his homeland .
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said in a statement he " welcomed the prosecution and conviction of one of the ringleaders of international neo-Nazism and biggest distributers of vicious racist publications " .
" It is high time he was behind bars , " the opposition Social Democrats said in a statement .
Lauck , dressed in a sober blue suit and sporting his trademark Hitleresque black moustache , showed no sign of emotion as Bertram spent more than an hour reading out the verdict and explaining the court 's decision .
But as Lauck was about to be led away , he turned to reporters and blurted out a virtually incomprehensible quick-fire diatribe against the court .
" Neither the National Socialists ( Nazis ) nor the communists dared to kidnap an American citizen , " he shouted , in an oblique reference to his extradition to Germany from Denmark . "
That 's the truth . "
His attorney , Hans-Otto Sieg , told reporters outside the courtroom that the judges had not explained how a German court could judge someone for actions carried out in the United States .
Bertram said Lauck was obsessed by Nazism and devoted his life to leading his National Socialist German Workers ' Party Foreign Organisation ( NSDAP-AO ) , which derives its name from the full German title of Hitler 's Nazi party .
During the three-month trial , the court dealt mainly with issues of the NSDAP-AO 's " NS Kampfruf " ( " National Socialist Battle Cry " ) magazine , filled with references to Aryan supremacy and defamatory statements about Jews .
The court rejected Sieg 's argument that Lauck 's extradition from Denmark , where he was arrested in March last year at the request of German authorities , was illegal .
Lauck was also convicted of disseminating the symbols of anti-constitutional organisations .
He will probably be free in around two and a half years .
The court ruled that the <number> months he has spent in custody since his arrest should be subtracted from his prison term .

" The Russian side confirmed that the ceasefire is in place and they will keep to it , " Erdmann told Reuters after speaking by telephone to Ischinger , who had met the officials on a two-day visit to Moscow .

Ischinger is the political director of Bonn 's foreign ministry .

India says sees no arms race with China , Pakistan .
NEW DELHI <number>
India said on Thursday that its opposition to a global nuclear test ban treaty did not mean New Delhi intended to enter into an arms race with neighbouring Pakistan and China .
Foreign Minister I.K. Gujral was asked at a news conference if India 's decision to block adoption of the accord in Geneva would lead to an arms race with Pakistan and China .
" I do n't see that possibility because India is not entering into any arms race , " he said . "
Our not signing a new treaty does not mean we are going in for any new kind of weapons , particularly nuclear . "
China , along with Britain , France , Russia and the United States , is a declared nuclear power .
India carried out a nuclear test in <number> but says it has not built the bomb .
Experts believe both India and Pakistan could quickly assemble nuclear weapons .
Gujral said he did not expect India 's veto of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) to damage bilateral ties with other nations .
" I do not visualise its straining our bilateral relations with any country .
The text has already been blocked , " he said .
Gujral said India would re-examine its position if the treaty , particularly a clause providing for its entry into force , was modified .
Asked what India would do if the pact were forwarded to the United Nations General Assembly , Gujral said : " That bridge I will cross when I come to it . "
In a written statement released at the news conference , Gujral reiterated India 's objections to the treaty , under negotiation at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva .
" It is a sad fact that the nuclear weapon states show no interest in giving up their nuclear hegemony , " the statement said .
Gujral said India had national security concerns that made it impossible for New Delhi to sign the CTBT .

India RBI chief sees cut in cash reserve ratio .
NEW DELHI <number>
The Reserve bank of India governor C. Rangarajan said on Thursday that he expected the cash reserve ratio ( CRR ) maintained by banks to be reduced over the medium term .
" Over the medium term , yes , " he told Reuters after addressing industrialists in the capital .
He denied having said in a recent newspaper interview that the CRR could be raised if necessary .
He said he was only trying ( in that newspaper report ) to explain the theoretical position on the use of the CRR by central banks to manage money supply .
Rangarajan explained that the cash reserve ratio was an instrument that central banks could use to regulate money supply by reducing or increasing the ratio .
But in the current context , the government stood by an earlier commitment to reduce it over a period of time , he said in response to a question .

Two pct India current account deficit viable - RBI .
BOMBAY <number>
The Reserve Bank of India Governor Chakravarty Rangarajan said on Thursday that a current account deficit of two percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) was sustainable given the currrent rate of growth .
" The current account deficit of around two percent of GDP is a sustainable level of deficit given the expected real growth rate and the trends in imports and exports , " Rangarajan said in an address to business leaders in New Delhi .
Rangarajan said a current account deficit of two percent brought about by a <number> percent annual growth in exports and a <number> percent rise in imports along with an increase in non-debt flows could lead to a reduction in the debt-service ratio to below <number> percent over the next five years .

Mother Teresa devoted to world 's poor .
CALCUTTA <number>
Mother Teresa , known as the Saint of the Gutters , won the Nobel Peace Prize in <number> for bringing hope and dignity to millions of poor , unwanted people with her simple message : " The poor must know that we love them . "
While the world heaps honours on her and even regards her as a living saint , the nun of Albanian descent maintains she is merely doing God 's work .
" It gives me great joy and fulfilment to love and care for the poor and neglected , " she said . "
The poor do not need our sympathy and pity .
They need our love and compassion . "
The diminutive Roman Catholic missionary was on respiratory support in intensive care in an Indian nursing home on Thursday after suffering heart failure .
But an attending doctor said Mother Teresa , who turns <number> next Tuesday , was conscious and in stable condition .
The task Mother Teresa began alone in <number> in the slums of densely-populated Calcutta , and grew to touch the hearts of people around the world .
When in <number> she was told she had won the Nobel Peace Prize , she said characteristically : " I am unworthy . "
The world disagreed , showering more than <number> national and international honours on her including the Bharat Ratna , or Jewel of India , the country 's highest civilian award .
Her health began to deteriorate in <number> when she was fitted with a heart pacemaker .
A year later , the Vatican announced she was stepping down as Superior of her Missionaries of Charity order .
More than <number> delegates flew in from around the world to elect a successor .
They could not agree , so asked her to stay on .
She agreed .
In <number> , Mother Teresa was treated at a California hospital for heart disease and bacterial pneumonia .
In <number> , she fell in Rome and broke three ribs .
In August the same year , while in New Delhi to receive yet another award , she developed malaria , complicated by her heart and lung problems .
Last April she fractured her left collar bone .
But her increasing frailty , arthritis and failing eyesight has not stopped her travels around the world to mingle with the poor and desperate .
Mother Teresa was born Agnes Goinxha Bejaxhiu to Albanian parents in Skopje , in what was then Serbia , on August <number> , <number> .
She attended a government school and was already deeply religious by the time she was <number> .
At the age of <number> she became a Loretto nun , hoping to work at the Order 's Calcutta mission .
She was sent to Loretto Abbey in Dublin and from there to India to begin her novitiate and teach geography at a convent school in Calcutta .
She said her divine call to work among the poor came in September , <number> . "
The message was quite clear , " she told one interviewer . "
I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them .
It was an order .
I knew where I belonged . "
The Vatican and the mother superior in Dublin approved and after intensive training as a nurse with American missionaries she opened her first Calcutta slum school in December <number> .
She took the name of Teresa , after France 's Saint Therese of the Child Jesus .
In India she was simply called Mother .
Mother Teresa set up her first home for the dying in a Hindu rest house in Calcutta after she saw a penniless woman turned away by a city hospital .
Named " Nirmal Hriday " ( Tender Heart ) , it was the first of a chain of <number> homes for dying , destitute people , admitting nearly <number> a year .
Her Missionaries of Charity , a Roman Catholic religious order she founded in <number> , now runs about <number> homes for unwanted children and the destitute in India and abroad .
In <number> a British television documentary called the myth around Mother Teresa a mixture of " hyperbole and credulity " .
Catholics around the world rose to her defence .

RTRS - FOCUS-News forecasts alien-led profit boost .
Bernard Hickey
SYDNEY <number>
Media baron Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp Ltd reported lower than expected <number> profits on Thursday , but forecast that the hit film " Independence Day " would help increase profits by at least <number> percent in <number> .
" From an earnings perspective , the current fiscal year has begun with great promise due to the hit motion picture ' Independence Day , ' " News Corp said in a statement announcing its results for the year to June <number> , <number> .
It said moderating paper prices and solid orders for advertising at its Fox Broadcasting television network in the United States would also help boost profits in the <number> year . "
A budgeted profit increase of at least <number> percent for the full year currently appears very attainable , " News Corp said .
The bullish comments for the coming year soothed analysts and most shareholders , who were disappointed by the lower than expected profit for <number> .
News announced pre-abnormals net profit for the year fell six percent to A$ <number> billion ( US$ <number> million ) and earnings per share dropped to <number> cents from <number> cents .
Analysts had on average expected a pre-abnormals profit of A$ <number> billion .
" The year just gone was disappointing , but the outlook for the current year looks good , " First Pacific media analyst Lachlan Drummond said .
News Corp said strong performances in U.S. television and British newspapers were offset by lower profits from News Corp 's magazine and publishing divisions and further hefty losses from its Asian Star TV operations .
Higher newsprint prices hit profits hard . "
Throughout the group , higher paper prices increased costs by over US$ <number> million , " it said .
News Corp said British newspaper operating profits rose <number> percent for the year , as higher cover prices at The Sun and The Times and higher advertising volumes offset increased newsprint costs .
Advertising revenues at The Times grew <number> percent .
Analysts said sharply lower earnings from News Corp 's book publishing division and its U.S. magazines had been the major surprises in the results for <number> .
News Corp said revenue gains at its magazines and inserts division were offset by higher paper prices and lower sales at the U.S. TV Guide .
News said dramatically lower earnings from the British arm of its Harper-Collins publishing division more than offset healthy results from its U.S. operation .
It said the demise of the Net Book Agreement had hurt the British operations , and weak performances from the San Francisco unit of Harper-Collins had not helped .
The minimum price setting expired last September when three publishers pulled out .
But it was the bullish profit forecast for <number> that took the spotlight in the market , with some analysts saying <number> percent may even be an understatement .
" If they 're saying at least <number> percent , then their internal forecasts are probably saying <number> or <number> percent , " said one Sydney media analyst who declined to be named .

CANBERRA <number>
The Australian government 's plans to slash its budget deficit should make a useful contribution to national savings , the Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) said in its annual report .
" The government 's announced plans to balance the budget , if realised , would make a useful contribution to raising national savings , " the RBA said .

Ukraine hails peace as marks five-year independence .
Rostislav Khotin
KIEV <number>
Ukraine celebrates five years of independence from Kremlin rule on Saturday , hailing civil and inter-ethnic peace as its main post-Soviet achievement .
Ukraine 's declaration of independence in <number> , backed nine-to-one by a referendum in December of that year , effectively dealt a death blow to the Soviet empire and ended more than three centuries of rule from Moscow .
Ukraine , with a Russian community of <number> million people -- the world 's largest outside Russia -- has avoided conflicts like those in Russia 's Chechnya , neighbouring Moldova , and the former Soviet republics of Georgia , Azerbaijan and Tajikistan .
" Ukraine 's biggest achievements for five years are the preservation of civil peace and inter-ethnic harmony , " President Leonid Kuchma said in televised statement this week .
" Unlike many other post-Soviet countries we were able to deal with conflict situations in a peaceful and civilised way . "
But independence was initially accompanied by hyper-inflation and economic collapse , although there are signs of a turnaround .
Inflation -- a hyper-inflationary <number> percent a year in <number> -- was a respectable <number> percent a month in June and July and the economy has just begun to grow .
Kuchma told a solemn ceremony at the Ukraina Palace on Friday that " there was a turning point " in reforms and that he expected a rise in the standard of living in the near future .
" There is no doubt that economic growth has already started , " said Adelbert Knobl , head of the International Monetary Fund 's mission in Ukraine . "
The national bank and the government have every reason to be proud of their efforts . "
Central bank officials said on Thursday that a much-postponed hryvna currency would " definitely " be introduced before the end of this year .
It will replace the interim karbovanets currency , which was introduced at par to the Russian rouble in <number> but now trades at almost <number> karbovanets per rouble .
Ukraine has repeatedly promised to introduce the hryvna but had to postpone the plans because of economic problems .
Proud of its record in promptly joining both the Council of Europe and NATO 's Partnership for Peace , Ukraine caused a foreign policy wrangle this week , offending China by allowing a Taiwanese minister to appear on a public , if unofficial visit .
China cancelled a visit by a top-level delegation in protest .
Kiev 's Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko said Beijing was overreacting .
But Ukraine , seeing itself as a bridge between Russia and the rapidly Westernising countries of eastern Europe , is looking West as well as East .
" The strategic aim of European integration should not in any way damage Ukraine 's interests in post-Soviet areas .
Relations with Russia , which is our main partner , have great importance , " Kuchma said .
" But Ukraine cannot be economically oriented on Russia , even though those in some circles push us to do that . "
Kuchma has said Kiev wants membership of the European Union , associate membership of the Western European Union defence grouping and to move closer to NATO .
A message from the West this week from U.S. President Bill Clinton congratulated Ukraine on the anniversary , promising to support market reforms and praising Ukraine as a " stabilising factor " in a united Europe .

Russia to clamp down on barter deals .
MOSCOW <number>
Russian officials , keen to cut capital flight , will adopt tight measures to cut barter deals in foreign trade to a minimum , a customs official said on Friday .
" We have always been concerned about barter deals with other countries , viewing them as a disguised kind of capital flight from Russia , " Marina Volkova , deputy head of the currency department at the State Customs Committee , told Reuters .
Volkova said last year goods had been exported under many Russian barter deals , with nothing imported in return .
She said the cost of such unimported goods was $ <number> billion in <number> .
Barter deals were worth $ <number> billion last year , or about eight percent of all Russian exports estimated at $ <number> billion , she said .
" The cost of exported goods is too often understated , so the actual share of barter deals in Russian exports and the amount of unimported goods may be even higher , " Volkova said .
A few days ago Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree on state regulation of foreign barter deals , and Volkova said this " could substantially improve the situation " .
In line with the decree , which will come into force on November <number> , all Russian barter traders will be obliged to import goods worth the cost of their exports within <number> days .
" If traders are late , they will have to pay fines worth the cost of their exported goods , " Volkova said .
Understating the cost of exported goods could still be a loophole for barter dealers , but Volkova said the authorities are currently " tackling the technicalities of the issue " .
Barter has always been a feature of the Soviet Union 's foreign trade , but Yeltsin 's decrees liberalising foreign trade in <number> has given barter a new impetus .
A few years ago , barter deals accounted for up to <number> percent of Russian exports because " thousands ( of ) trade companies which popped up preferred barter in the absence of reliable Russian banks and money transfer systems " , Volkova said .
" Now many Russian banks are strong and can make various sorts of money tranfers , while incompetent traders are being ousted by more experienced ones .
But the current share of barter deals in Russian exports is still high , " she said .

TENNIS - AUSTRALIANS ADVANCE AT CANADIAN OPEN .
TORONTO <number>
It was Australia Day at the $ <number> million Canadian Open on Thursday as three Aussies reached the quarter-finals with straight-set victories .
Unseeded Patrick Rafter recorded the most noteworthy result as he upset sixth-seeded American MaliVai Washington <number> <number> in just <number> minutes .
Todd Woodbridge , who defeated Canadian Daniel Nestor <number> ( <number> ) <number> ( <number> ) , and Mark Philippoussis , a <number> <number> winner over Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic , also advanced and will meet in Friday 's quarter-finals .
Third-seeded Wayne Ferreira of South Africa defeated Tim Henman of Britain <number> <number> after a three-hour evening rain delay and fifth-seeded Thomas Enqvist of Sweden won his third-round match , eliminating Petr Korda of the Czech Republic <number> <number> .
Ferreira and Enqvist play in a Friday night quarter-final .
Two Americans , seventh seed Todd Martin and unseeded Alex O'Brien , will meet on Friday after winning matches on Thursday .
Martin overcame Cedric Pioline of France <number> <number> <number> and O'Brien beat Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden <number> <number> <number> .
" If you really look at the match , " said the <number> Washington after losing to the <number> Rafter , " I never really got a chance to play because he was serving big and getting in close to the net .
" He was also able to handle my serve pretty easily because my ( first ) service percentage was only in the <number> .
Put those two things together and you get a loss . "
Rafter missed <number> weeks after wrist surgery earlier this year and the time away from tennis has given him a new perspective .
" Before when I was on tour , I always felt I had to be in bed by <number> or <number> o'clock and I had to be up at a certain time , " Rafter said . "
Now I can go to bed at at midnight or wake up at seven in the morning .
I just do n't have as many set routines and it 's made me a happier person . "
Martin was pleased with his victory over Pioline , his first in five meetings with the <number> Frenchman . "
It 's always difficult to win a match when you lose the first set , especially against someone you have never beaten , " he said .
" I got more aggressive in the second and third sets and the wind picked up and that also affected things because Cedric definitely went off a little bit . "
The <number> O'Brien , who won the ATP Tour stop in New Haven last week , has now won <number> of his last <number> matches , dating back to qualifying rounds in Los Angeles in late July .
He ranks <number> after being <number> four weeks ago .
" I feel I 'm hitting the ball well even though I 'm having more mental letdowns than I did last week , " O'Brien said . "
But I 'm still competing well . "
" I got a lot of first serves in , " said Enqvist about his victory over Korda . "
I did n't miss that many shots and he was making the mistakes . "
Still marvelling at an exciting <number> rally he won in the last game of his second-round match against Javier Sanchez of Spain on Tuesday , Enqvist joked , " Today against Petr there were about <number> strokes in the whole match .
It was mostly short points . "

CRICKET - SRI LANKA AND AUSTRALIA SAY RELATIONS HAVE HEALED .
COLOMBO <number>
Sri Lanka and Australia agreed on Friday that relations between the two teams had healed since the Sri Lankans ' acrimonious tour last year .
The Sri Lankans were first found guilty then cleared of ball tampering and off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was called for throwing during a controversial three-test series in Australia .
" Our concern is to get out there and play proper cricket , " Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga told a news conference on the eve of a warmup match between the World Cup champions and a World XI team scheduled for Saturday .
" What happened is history . "
Australian team manager Cam Battersby said he agreed with Ranatunga .
" I believe relations between the two teams will be excellent , " Batterby said .
The Australians are making their first visit to the Indian Ocean island since boycotting a World Cup fixture in February after a terrorist bomb in Colombo .

The tournament , starting on August <number> , also includes India and Zimbabwe .

Colombia , U.S. reach aviation agreement .
MIAMI <number>
The U.S. and Colombian governments reached an agreement that will allow AMR Corp 's American Airlines to operate three round-trip flights between New York and Bogota , the Department of Transportation said Friday .
Under the agreement , which followed talks in Miami this week , AMR also will be allowed to shift up to four of the weekly flights it now operates between Miami and Colombia to its New York gateway .
The United States also will be able to designate one new all-cargo carrier for service between the two nations after two years .
Colombia was permitted to add a single additional round-trip flight to its current New York service , although it will not be able to do so while under Category Two ( Conditional ) status under the Federal Aviation Administration 's International Aviation Safety program .
Colombia would be allowed to add new service when its safety assessment has been improved , the department said .
With the exception of the new services just agreed to , the governments of the two nations have agreed to maintain their current level of routes and airlines for the next <number> years , the agreement said .
The agreement resolved a dispute that arose in June when Colombia turned down American 's request to operate flights between New York and Bogota , a denial that prompted the United States to charge that the Colombians were breaking a bilateral aviation agreement and to propose sanctions against one of two Colombian airlines , Avianca and ACES .

Soccer - Arab team breaks new ground in Israel .
Ori Lewis
TAIBE , Israel <number>
For the first time in Israeli history , an Arab team will take the field when the National League soccer season starts on Saturday .
Hapoel Taibe fields four Jewish players and two foreign imports -- a Pole and a Romanian .
The rest of the side is made up mainly of Moslem Arabs .
The club , founded in <number> , has a loyal following in Taibe , an Arab town of <number> in the heart of Israel .
But away from their home ground , they face unfriendly crowds who taunt the players with racist abuse .
" The very first thing we thought about after we knew we would be promoted was the game against Betar Jerusalem , " said Taibe supporter Karem Haj Yihye .
Two weeks ago Taibe , coached by Pole Wojtek Lazarek , met Betar , a club closely associated with the right-wing Likud party , for the first time in a Cup match in Jerusalem .
Chants from the crowd of " Death to the Arabs " , and bottle-throwing during the game marred the match which ended in a goalless draw .
One Taibe supporter required hospital treatment for cuts and bruises after a stone struck his head as he was driving from the stadium .
" We 're used to hearing the taunts of " Death to the Arabs ' , " said Sameh Haj Yihye , a Taibe resident who studies at Jerusalem 's Hebrew University . "
But we know that these are only words , nobody has died from hearing them and it only makes us support our team more vehemently . "
The dusty town of Taibe lacks the amenities of Jewish communities and many Israeli Arabs have long complained of state discrimination .
" There are no parks or empty areas of land around here , so when we want to play a friendly game of soccer we all load up in the car and travel to Tel Aviv , " <number> km ( <number> miles ) away , Sameh Haj Yihye said .
The town 's ramshackle <number> ground is accessible only by two dirt tracks .
" We plan to build a <number> stadium , but it may well be situated elsewhere , " said club chairman Abdul Rahman Haj Yihye . "
We will discuss this with the mayor and hopefully a new or refurbished ground will be completed by the start of the new year . "
In the meantime , Taibe will play all their heavily policed home matches at the Jewish coastal town of Netanya .
" We are Israelis , there is no question about that , " said Karem Haj Yihye , a hotel waiter .
" We do n't have any connection with the Palestinians , they live over there , " he said , pointing to the West Bank seven km ( four miles ) to the east .
" We do n't feel our club represents Palestinian Arabs , " said club chairman Abdul Rahman . "
We are trying to do all we can to run a professional outfit , we are pleased at any support we get , but do not go out looking to represent the whole Arab world . "

Rebel fighters and Russian soldiers said a ceasefire effective at noon ( <number> GMT ) on Friday was being generally observed , although scattered gunfire echoed through the Chechen capital Grozny .
The Russian army said earlier it was preparing to withdraw from the rebel-dominated southern mountains of the region as part of the peace deal reached with separatists on Thursday .
" There has been some shooting from their side but it has been relatively quiet , " said fighter Aslan Shabazov , a bearded man wearing a white t-shirt and camoflage trousers .
Soon after he spoke another burst of gunfire rocked the courtyard where the rebels had set up their base and a captured Russian <number> tank roared out to investigate .
The separatists , who swept into Grozny on August <number> , still control large areas of the centre of town , and Russian soldiers are based at checkpoints on the approach roads .
" The ceasefire is being observed , " said woman soldier Svetlana Goncharova , <number> , short dark hair poking out from under a peaked camouflage cap .

Jordan expels Iraqi diplomat after bread riots .

AMMAN <number>
Jordan , which has blamed Iraq for bread riots last week , has asked an Iraqi diplomat to leave , official and diplomatic sources said on Friday .
The main Friday prayers in southern Jordan that were the starting point for the riots a week ago passed peacefully under tight security imposed by the army with only brief demonstrations reported .
Adel Ibrahim , the Iraqi embassy 's press attache , was asked to leave " because he was carrying out duties incompatible with diplomatic norms " , one source told Reuters , implying he was accused of spying .
Ibrahim told Reuters by telephone from his embassy office in Amman that he " had not been notified " of any explusion order .
The government declined official comment .
Ibrahim 's assistant , Hussein Khalaf , was expelled earlier this year for similar reasons amid rising tension in bilateral ties after King Hussein began calling for change in Baghdad following top Iraqi defections in August <number> .
Iraq retaliated then by expelling a junior administrator working in the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad but has continued its policy of trying to avoid public conflicts with Jordan -- its only secure route to the rest of the world .
Jordan has accused Iraq and a local pro-Baghdad party for the country 's worst unrest in seven years which erupted after it almost doubled the prices of bread last week under radical economic reforms agreed with the International Monetary Fund .
In Karak , where two days of riots flared last Friday , a few hundred young men lingered outside Omari mosque on leaving , shouting slogans for about <number> minutes .
" Disperse , abstain from forming groups and help maintain order , " army officers , who has enforced a loose curfew since the riots , told the crowd through loudspeakers .
The men shouted " Allahu Akbar " ( God is Greatest ) as a former Islamist deputy , Ahmed Kafawin , told soldiers the crowd would not cause trouble .
He had earlier mounted the mosque 's pulpit to demand release of detainees , an end to raids on houses and the cancelling of the bread price rises .
Armoured cars had patrolled streets in Karak , traditional bastion of communist ideology and Baath socialism that swept the region in the <number> , and guarded entrances to the hill-top city famed for its Crusader castle before the prayers .
There was also heavy security in the crowded centre of Amman , where smaller clashes had erupted last Saturday , but Friday prayers at the main mosque ended quietly as police in full riot gear looked on .
The Jordanian Arab Socialist Baath Party , which has one deputy in the <number> lower house of parliament , has denied involvement in unrest which it blamed on government policies and rising economic hardship .
Government attempts to link the rioting to foreign influence has been treated with derision by those in the streets who blame the protests on severe economic hardships .

OPTIONS - Euro debt vols seen regrouping after fall .
LONDON <number>
Implied volatility of European bond and interest rate options should stabilise around current levels until early next week after falling before and after this week 's German-led cut in interest rates , traders said .
" Volatility has come off a lot .
We 're looking for it to stabilise now , " said one Euromark options trader at a U.S. bank .
A trader at a Japanese bank said Euromark volatility now stood at <number> for September contract , <number> for December , <number> for March and <number> for June .
This compared with midweek levels , before the welter of interest rate cuts , of <number> for September , <number> for December , <number> for March and <number> for June , he said .
At <number> GMT , December Euromark futures were trading at <number> , two basis points down on the day .
He said the sell-off in June vols might have been overdone , which could offer value at current levels .
He said caps and floors would be well bid after the round of interest rate cuts due to the fact these rates should stay low at the short end .
The size of the Bundesbank 's repo rate cut , to <number> percent from <number> percent , took markets by surprise .
" Volatility has a bid to it -- longer-dated volatility more than short-dated because the event people were buying for has passed and now perhaps people will sell some short dated vol and buy some long dated vol , " he said .
" Long dated volatility has been low this year , so it is still at levels which are not historically high .
" It is not a dangerous level to own vol. You are not going to lose a lot and you could make quite a bit . "
He said volatility levels should be stable until markets reassess the situation after a long weekend in Britain .
Paribas Capital Markets OTC options specialist Robert Coughlan said that if volatility continued lower for the rest of Friday in over-the-counter <number> Bunds , it should be higher next Tuesday .
He said the absence on holiday of many market makers was a main factor behind falls this week in volatility in high-yielding markets such as Italy , Spain and Sweden .
Coughlan said the market had more downside than upside potential , but a fall was not likely to be of significant size .
" I recommend people sell strangles in a number of markets -- in Germany and France in particular .
" With high-yielding markets Italy will be a lot more vulnerable in September on economic and political fronts , so I would use current the low level of vol to buy options .
" So sell options on Bunds and France to enhance yield and buy options on Italy , " Coughlan said ..

A consortium of telephone companies and The Walt Disney Co .
said Thursday it had signed a $ <number> billion contract with Zenith to make digital televison set-top boxes for its home entertainment service .
The announcement of the contract for <number> million set-top boxes gave new hope to Zenith , which has struggled with years of losses .
" This really indicates we 're back in the business , " William Luehrs , president of the Glenview , Ill.-based company 's Networks Services Division , said in a telephone interview . "
Anytime somebody gets the opportunity to enter the next era with such a big bang has got to be seen as a strong message to the industry . "
Following the announcement , Zenith 's stock soared $ <number> to $ <number> on the New York Stock Exchange .
The consortium , called Americast , said the contract was part of its strategy to develop and market the next generation in home entertainment .
In addition to Disney , Americast 's partners are phone companies Ameritech Corp. , BellSouth Corp. , GTE Corp. and SBC Communications .
Americast said Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. has signed a letter of intent to join the group , which plans to provide a home entertainment service similar to cable television .
Zenith also said it planned to build a new $ <number> million plant in Woodridge , Ill .
, to make picture tubes for <number> and <number> screen TV sets .
The company currently buys the tubes from competitors .
The new plant , which is dependent on obtaining financing , will create about <number> new jobs , Zenith said .
The contract calls for production of the set-top boxes over five years .
Luehrs said manufacturing will begin and revenue will start to roll in during the first half of next year .
The boxes will be made on a build-to-order basis .
Zenith will convert its Chihuahua , Mexico , analogue set-top box plant to manufacture the digital boxes .
Luehrs declined to say when the operation was expected to be profitable .
Americast will provide the boxes to subscribers as part of the service .
Its service is being introduced in selected markets across the United States .
Luehrs said digital technology in set-top boxes is only the beginning and said the technology will eventually show up in retail consumer electronics .
" We 'll build a lot of these devices into television sets , for digital television , " he said . "
Although that is not where this particular contract is headed , the fact that there is a strong Zenith presence will pay us dividends in the future . "
Zenith has been plagued by generally soft conditions in the colour television industry , reporting full-year losses since <number> .

Huge Windows <number> sales fail to meet expectations .
Martin Wolk
SEATTLE <number>
A year after its massively publicized introduction , Microsoft Corp. 's Windows <number> computer operating system has fallen short of the most optimistic expectations for the software giant and the industry .
Even though more than <number> million copies of Windows <number> have been sold , making it the fastest-selling new software ever , it would have been impossible for any product to live up to the unprecedented hype of the Aug. <number> , <number> launch , when stores around the world opened at midnight to greet long lines of customers .
The Redmond , Wash.-based company spent tens of millions of dollars promoting the product with stunts that included buying the entire print run of the Times of London and lighting New York 's Empire State building in a Windows color scheme .
But the product , delivered eight months late , has fallen short of its sales potential in part because Microsoft delivered a mixed message to business customers , analysts said .
" It did n't do as well as it could have , " said Rob Enderle , an analyst with Giga Information Group .
Scores of software and hardware companies that had hoped for a big boost in sales were disappointed when only a brief spike materialized .
" People who were expecting major coat-tails were somewhat disappointed , " said Scott Winkler , an analyst with Gartner Group .
" It 's not as though it has n't had an impact , " he said . "
It just has n't had the huge earth-shattering impact some people were looking for . "
Symantec Corp. , which had been among the most bullish of software companies at the time of the Windows <number> launch , ended up posting disappointing financial results when retail sales of the operating system fell short of its projections .
Touchstone Software Corp. had to pay $ <number> million in cash and stock to settle a shareholders lawsuit brought after the company 's sales failed to meet expectations tied to the Windows <number> launch .
Many software developers apparently saw their crucial holiday season sales suffer last year because store shelves were jammed with blue-and-white boxes of Windows <number> , resulting in a shortage of space for seasonal products , said Ann Stephens , president of PC Data Inc .
To be sure , sales of Windows <number> and the accompanying Office <number> upgrade drove Microsoft sales up <number> percent last year to a record $ <number> billion and cemented the company 's status as the industry 's dominant company .
Microsoft executives say they are thrilled with the sales figures , and industry analysts estimate that by sometime next year , the installed base of Windows <number> will surpass that of the older version of Windows , now used on about <number> million computers worldwide .
But Enderle said the figure could have been even higher if Microsoft had done a better job of handling the huge demand for technical support from customers who were frustrated trying to install the system .
He and other analysts said corporate America adopted a go-slow approach because Microsoft already was promoting the new version of its high-end Windows NT operating system , expected to be available in stores in the next several weeks .
" Microsoft sent a lot of signals that NT was going to be the answer , " Winkler said . "
Many people began to believe that Windows <number> was being downplayed . "
But now that Windows NT <number> has been launched , Winkler and others believe only a relatively small proportion of corporate users will elect to pay the added software and hardware costs needed to use it instead of Windows <number> .
" Windows <number> is going to do great , " he said . "
The mistake people made was in thinking it was going to be a fast , sweeping change rather than a slow , building change . "

U.S. says still committed to Cuba migration pacts .

The United States said on Thursday it remained committed to migration accords with Cuba and would continue to repatriate intercepted Cuban migrants who attempted to enter U.S. territory illegally .

" The United States will continue to return Cuban migrants intercepted at sea who seek to enter the United States or the Guantanamo Naval Base illegally , " it said .

Davies told reporters the statement would be distributed in the Cuban exile community in Miami " to remind everyone of the importance of abiding by the accords and avoiding dangerous attempts to cross the straits " from Cuba to Florida .
Havana 's complaints centred on an incident in which a boatload of emigrants capsized in the Florida Straits last week and two recent aircraft hijackings from Cuba .
Sixteen of those picked up from the boat were returned to Cuba but eight were taken to the United States and three to Guantanamo Bay , a U.S. base on Cuba , until they emigrated to another nation .
The most recent hijacking , last Friday , involved three hijackers and the pilot of a small aircraft .
Davies said on Tuesday the pilot could soon return to Cuba but U.S. authorities planned to try the hijackers .
In an incident on July <number> , a Cuban interior ministry official hijacked a commercial plane and sought aylum at Guantanamo Bay .

" We 're investigating with the idea that both fires may be arson , but that has n't been conclusively established , " said Wayne Jordan , a spokesman for the Arkansas State Police .
Agents of the F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms were also at the scene , Jordan said .
Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church and St. Matthews Missionary Baptist Church were both frame structures , each near Turner , Arkansas , a small community surrounded by cotton and soybean fields .
" This is rural Arkansas .
I 'm surprised anyone could even find us out here , " said Fannie Johnson , a member of St. Matthew 's , who said she believed arson was to blame .
Others connected with the two churches said they shared that suspicion , although all said they knew of no motive and no racial tension in the area .
" It 's sad someone would have that kind of spite in their heart , " said Rev. Jerome Turner , pastor of Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church .
Arkansas has been spared the loss of predominantly black churches to arson , a wave that has claimed an estimated <number> houses of worship across the south in the past several months .
A black church near Camden , Arkansas , about <number> miles ( <number> kms ) south of Little Rock , burned in July , but federal agents have not determined the cause .

Sea lion paparazzi to keep tabs on whales .
LONDON <number>
U.S. marine biologists have trained a pair of sea lions to tag and photograph elusive whales as they cruise through the Pacific depths , New Scientist magazine reported on Thursday .
James Harvey and Jennifer Hurley of the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in California say their sea lions , natural companions of many species of whale , can go where no man or woman has ever gone before .
" Any diver knows that when a whale gets going you ca n't keep up , " Harvey told the magazine . "
That is why we know only about five percent of what whales do . "
The sea lions -- <number> Beaver and nine-year-old Sake -- have undergone six years of training for their mission .
Beaver once worked for the U.S. Navy and Sake is an amusement park veteran .
Harvey said they could accurately tag whales with a radio transmitter , and could also swim all the way around one of the giant mammals , filming it with a video camera .
Their first assignment , later this year , will be documenting humpback whale migration off Monterey , California .
The article did not spell out exactly how the sea lions manage to tag the whales but said in training they were taught to stick a radio transmitter on to a plastic model of a whale using suction cups .

China copper stocks owned by state reserve - trade .
Lynne O'Donnell
HONG KONG <number>
Up to <number> tonnes of copper held in Shanghai bonded warehouses , confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate , probably belongs to China 's strategic state reserve , industry sources said on Friday .
Around <number> tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou , where some of the strategic stockpile was stored , they said .
Just who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into Shanghai by the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp ( CNIEC ) in June and July .
It was unclear whether or not the <number> tonnes had cleared customs -- which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve , administered directly by the central government 's State Planning Commission , owned the copper .
Traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties -- three percent import tax and <number> percent value-added tax -- that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise .
But one source , the head of a Hong Kong trading house , said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not .
" If they spend all this money moving the copper to Yingkou , it will be sitting there for years , " he said .
" Once it arrives in Yingkou , it is subject to monitoring by the State Planning Commission , which has to give permission for any more movement ; it is out of the hands of traders , " he said .
Mystery has surrounded the Shanghai stockpile in recent months , with traders unsure not only of who owns it , but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it .
Trading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) .
A backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price .
CNIEC lent around <number> tonnes of copper onto the LME between April and June <number> on behalf of the state reserve , running the state stockpile down to <number> tonnes from <number> tonnes previously .
Traders in Asia said CNIEC could well have lent it to the market at around US$ <number> a tonne , and then paid somewhere between $ <number> and $ <number> a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year .
This would have cleared CNIEC a healthy profit , which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs .
Word that CNIEC had offered the copper to European trading houses in a series of secret meetings unnerved an already jittery market .
Industry analysts Bloomsbury Minerals Economics ( BME ) said on Wednesday the motivation of the owners of the <number> tonnes , " whoever they are , is the most important short-term fundamental " in an already tight world market .
BME repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by Sumitomo Corp , with CNIEC said to be helping the Japanese trader unload its copper positions after it revealed in June losses of $ <number> billion in a decade of unauthorised deals .
Sumitomo and CNIEC have made no comments on the talk and Chinese traders said they know nothing of such an arrangement .
Traders in Shanghai said on Thursday they were unaware of movements out of the Shanghai bonded warehouses .
They reported more arrivals that were probably spot purchases .
They also expressed concern that the tonnage in bonded warehouses would move onto the domestic market .
But these concerns were irrelevant , a Singapore trader said , despite a forecast that domestic Chinese copper demand could hit one million tonnes this year .
As with many commodities , " there is a desire ( by the Chinese government ) to keep a stockpile of the metal , " he said . "
You do n't keep it to help industry , you keep it in case of emergency . "

AMSTERDAM <number>
Dutch champions Ajax Amsterdam faltered in their second league match of the season on Saturday losing <number> away at Heerenveen .
Ajax , who had a dismal series of pre-season results before beating NAC of Breda in their opening game , had the best of an entertaining first half but failed to break the deadlock .
Eight minutes after the interval , Heerenveen 's Romeo Wouden broke through the Amsterdam defence , left defender John Veldman standing and curled the ball beyond goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar into the Ajax net .
Ajax , without injured defenders Marcio Santos and Winston Bogarde and strikers Jari Litmanen and Marc Overmars , then stepped up the pace and looked certain to equalise .
But they left gaps at the back and on <number> minutes Danish striker Jon Dahl Tomasson rushed out of his own half , beat the Ajax defence and lobbed van der Sar .
The defeat means Ajax 's main title contenders PSV Eindhoven , who beat the champions <number> in the traditional league curtain-raiser , can go three points clear of their rivals if they beat Groningen on Sunday .

When asked if he would return to the mountainous region where rebels have been fighting Russian troops for full independence , Penrose said : " Not for the time being .

HARARE <number>
The Zimbabwean government fired thousands of workers on Saturday for defying an order to end a strike which has crippled essential services and disrupted international and domestic flights .
The Public Service Commission ( PSC ) said in a statement that the workers -- including nurses , junior doctors , mortuary attendants , customs officers and firefighters -- would be barred from entering their workplaces on Monday .
" All civil servants who did not return to work at their normal working hours , and remained working for the full working day on <number> August <number> , have been summarily dismissed ...

Union officials from the Public Service Association ( PSA ) were unavailable for comment .
Public Service , Labour and Social Welfare Minister Florence Chitauro told state radio her ministry had already begun recruiting other people to replace the strikers , sub-contracting some of the work to private firms .
The government had been threatening to fire the workers since the strike began on Tuesday , saying it was illegal .
But the strikers ignored the threat and vowed to stay on the streets until their demands for wage rises of <number> to <number> percent were met .
The stoppage has left essential services stretched with many hospitals handling only emergency cases under senior doctors with the help of army medical personnel and the Red Cross .

Revered skull of S. Africa king is Scottish woman 's .

A limelight-loving South African chief was in disgrace on Saturday after a prized skull he brought home from Scotland was identified as belonging not to his sacred tribal ancestor , but to a middle-aged white woman .
A forensic scientist who examined the supposed skull of <number> century King Hintsa , a chief of President Nelson Mandela 's Xhosa tribe killed in battle by the British , said it was in fact the cranium of a European woman .
Chief Nicholas Gcaleka , dressed in animal skins and full tribal regalia , journeyed to a wintry Scotland in February on a hugely publicised quest to find Hintsa 's skull .
The witchdoctor said ancestors had appeared to him in a dream and ordered him to return the head , said to have been carried off as a colonial trophy by the officer who shot and allegedly beheaded Hintsa after a battle in <number> .
But Gcaleka ran into trouble as soon as he returned to South Africa with a skull he found in a cottage in a lonely Highland forest near Inverness .
He said the spirit of a hurricane had guided him there .
Members of the Xhosa royal family , branding Gcaleka a charlatan , confiscated the head and sent it for tests to a forensic scientist , who examined the shape of the skull and the hole that he determined had not come , as supposed , from a bullet .
" It can be stated beyond reasonable doubt that this skull is not that of the late king , " the scientist said in a statement .

Albania 's opposition Socialist Party began a two-day congress on Saturday to discuss major jettisoning its links with almost half a century of Stalinist dictatorship in the Balkan country .
" The congress will approve new concepts that will turn the party into a Social-Democratic and electoral party , not a class and ideological one , " the Socialist Zeri i Popullit daily said in an editorial .
Jailed Socialist leader Fatos Nano made the first call for change in July , a month after the party 's chief opponents , the conservative Democrats of President Sali Berisha , almost swept the board in a disputed general election .
The Socialists , reformed heirs to the communists , pulled out of the poll saying it was a sham .
Acting Socialist leader Servet Pellumbi has said he too will urge the party to scrap the ideas of Karl Marx at the congress .
The pro-reform stance of some of the party leadership initially caused a storm and triggered the resignation last month of the party 's Secretary-General Gramoz Ruci .

Kurdish group says two killed in Iraqi shelling .

An Iraqi Kurdish guerrilla group on Saturday accused Iraqi government forces of killing two civilians in shelling in northern Iraq , the Iranian news agency IRNA reported .
IRNA said it was monitoring a report from a radio station affiliated to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) .
" Iraqi army heavily shelled the Kanie Karzhala camp , west of Arbil , on Friday ...
Two civilians were killed in the Iraqi bombing , " IRNA quoted the radio report as saying .

Clinton campaign busy making " news " .
Laurence McQuillan
WASHINGTON <number>
President Bill Clinton has served notice he intends to be busy " making news " -- or at least doing things that look and sound like it in a campaign year .
With Democrats gathering in Chicago to start a convention on Monday to nominate him for a second term as president , Clinton plans a steady parade of events designed to highlight his leadership and dim the glow of the just-concluded Republican conclave that gave a boost to rival Bob Dole .
After a week of carefully orchestrated events signing into law bills passed by the Republican-controlled Congress , Clinton used his Saturday radio address to the nation to proudly " announce " a development in the war on crime .
" Sixty days ago I directed the attorney general to draw up a plan for a national registry of sex offenders , " Clinton said . "
That plan has now reached my desk . "
" Today I am pleased to announce that we are following through on our commitment to keep track of these criminals , not just in a single state but wherever they go , " he said .
Actually , creation of such a registry was underway without Clinton lifting a finger .
Attorney General Janet Reno 's report -- all nine pages of it , including footnotes -- offers only the interim services of the FBI until a formal registry on sex offenders has been established .
Two months ago , Clinton announced he wanted an interim effort established .
Now , <number> days later , he had a chance to talk about it again .
It is an example of Clinton 's strategic planning as he heads into the stretch drive for the Nov. <number> presidential election .
Such things do not happen by chance in the Clinton White House , they are part of his political chess game .
In the past week Clinton signed into law an increase in the minimium wage , a bill that makes it easier for someone with a pre-existing health problem to change jobs , and sweeping changes overhauling the nation 's welfare system .
" America can look back on a week of remarkable achievement , " Clinton said , without even a passing reference to the Republican majority in the House and Senate .
" America is on the right track offering more opportunity , demanding more responsibility , building a stronger community , the sense of shared values and stronger families , " he said in striking the theme of his coming week .
According to a senior campaign official , Clinton " will be making a lot of news in the coming week -- something different each day . "
Clinton departs on Sunday on a four-day train trip through West Virginia , Kentucky , Ohio , Michigan and Indiana while fellow Democrats are gathered in Chicago .
" He 'll make news during the day ... and then at night the attention will go to the convention , " said the campaign official . "
We think it 'll work really well . "
Although officials decline to say just what each day 's " news " will be , the intent is to put a focus on Clinton himself and not just those attending the party 's convention .
Each day of the trip will have a late start , so that network television correspondents will be able to do live reports for morning programmes .
Campaign officials then hope the day 's " news " event will be showcased on evening television news shows as a lead-in for that night 's convention programme .
" We 'll be concentrating ... on supporting the president as he is on the trip and making significant public policy statements related to some of his plans for the future , " said White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry .
McCurry said that when Clinton delivers his acceptance address on Thursday night to fellow Democrats and a national television audience , he will " set out a road map " for the nation 's future -- one the president hopes guides him back to the White House for four more years .

Italian comics hope independence-joke 's on Bossi .
ORVIETO , Italy <number>
A group of Italian comics hope the joke will be on separatist leader Umberto Bossi next month when they lead the ancient Etruscan town of Orvieto in a mock split from Rome .
Orvieto mayor Stefano Cimicchi said the comics , including popular actor Roberto Benigni , would declare Orvieto " capital of Etruria " on September <number> -- the day Bossi plans a march across the north in favour of independence from Rome .
" We will then proceed with the annexation of Sardinia , Corsica and Cyprus , " Cimicchi told reporters on Saturday .
He said the city council would be " ironically present " when the comics made their proclamation on the same day Bossi has threatened to declare the birth of Padania , the name he has given to northern Italy .
Orvieto , located in Umbria between Rome and Florence , was once the capital of Etruria , an ancient federation of <number> Etruscan towns .
" We want to pop some air out of this balloon of tension that has been blown up around September <number> , " Cimicchi said .
" We want to help turn down the rhetoric in a country that borders former Yugoslavia yet in which people are still talking about secession , " he added .
Bossi has intensified his separatist rhetoric since his Northern League party 's good showing in last April 's general election , when it took <number> percent of the vote nationally .
He has recently dropped a drive for federalism , saying secession from Rome 's wasteful and centralised bureaucracy is the only solution for northerners .

Belgium asks how paedophile suspect eluded police .
Jeremy Lovell
BRUSSELS <number>
Belgian police searched two more houses on Saturday for bodies in a child-sex scandal of murder , kidnapping and pornography that has sent a shockwave of revulsion throughout Europe .
Recriminations built up over how the scandal 's central figure , convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux , managed to prey on children unhindered for so long .
In just over a week two young girls have been found dead , from starvation , two have been freed from a dungeon-like secret compartment and an international hunt has started for at least two others .
On Saturday investigators with dogs trained to find bodies searched one house at Ransart and one at Mont-sur-Marchienne -- both suburbs of the southern city of Charleroi .
Both houses are owned by Dutroux .
Belgian media speculated that Dutroux , charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children , must have had high level protection to molest youngsters .
They put forward no proof to support the speculation , but seized on a comment by chief prosecutor Michel Bourlet on Belgian television on Friday night that he would chase down everyone involved in the case " if I am allowed to " .
Bourlet said between <number> and <number> paedophile porn video tapes had been seized , some of which featured Dutroux .
Dutroux was charged a week ago after police rescued two young girls from a concrete dungeon in the basement of one of the six houses he owns in and around Charleroi .
Just a day later the national euphoria at the rescue turned to disgust as Dutroux led police to the bodies of two eight-year-old girls in another of his houses .
Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo , had been kidnapped in June last year .
Dutroux said they starved to death nine months later .
He also admitted kidnapping two other girls , An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks , a year ago .
The fate of the girls is unknown , but there has been speculation they were sold into prostitution in Slovakia or the Czech Republic where Dutroux was a frequent visitor .
Belgian police have visited Bratislava and will visit Prague .
Five other people have been arrested including Dutroux 's second wife Michelle Martin , charged as an accomplice .
The others have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children or are suspected of criminal association .
Dutch police are also holding a <number> old Dutchman in connection with the disappearance of An and Eefje , although a spokesman said no direct link had yet been established .
At least part of the speculation in the Belgian media of high-level protection for Dutroux and his accomplices is based on leaked documents cataloguing a high degree of police bungling , incompetence and indifference .
Among the revelations are the fact that the gendarmerie was running a surveillance operation codenamed " Othello " against Dutroux in <number> -- when both Julie and Melissa and An and Eefje were kidnapped .
They show that the gendarmes were aware that Dutroux was building cells in some of his houses for holding children , yet this information was either not passed on to other police forces searching for the missing girls or was overlooked when it was .
They also show that police investigating a theft visited Dutroux late last year at the house where Julie and Melissa were being held but accepted his word that the children 's cries they could hear came from neighbours .
Justice Minister Stefaan De Clerck has admitted that mistakes were made and ordered an inquiry at the same time as stressing there were no indications of a cover-up .
There is also widespread disbelief that no one appeared to question how Dutroux , an unemployed father of three with no visible means of support , managed to own six houses .

Internet Startup funded to develop Java software .
MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif. <number>
A small team of engineers from Sun Microsystems Inc. 's JavaSoft unit said Sunday they have formed a new company , dubbed Internet Startup , to build Java infrastructure software .
The fledgling company , established in a ground-floor office here over the last two weeks , has received venture financing from Bessemer Venture Partners of Menlo Park , Calif ..
David Cowan , Internet Startup founder and acting chief executive , is a general partner of Bessemer .
The startup company 's acting chairman is Jim Bidzos , the president of RSA Data Security , a unit of Security Dynamics Technologies Inc. as well as chairman of VeriSign .
Internet Startup , which opened its doors with about half a dozen initial employees , combines experience at JavaSoft , Apple Computer Inc. , and Oracle Systems .
" Java portends dramatic changes in the way we use the Internet , " said Hong Bui , vice president of engineering of the new company after serving as a senior engineer at JavaSoft .
Java is a computer programming language introduced by Sun Microsystems in <number> which has immediately captured the attention of the industry for its ability to operate across virtually all computer system in a relatively secure manner .
Just last week , Sun Microsystems and the Silicon Valley venture capital giant Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers said they had completed financing of a $ <number> million fund managed by Kleiner Perkins to fund startups developing Java technologies .
Java has been licensed by nearly <number> organisations , ranging from Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. to the Taiwan government .
Prasad Wagle , another former senior JavaSoft engineer who is among the founding engineers at Internet Startup , said the new company aims to build software infrastructure using Java to make networked applications ubiquitious .
One feature of the Java language is that small software programmes , known as " applets " because they are small applications , can be downloaded from the server computers at the centre of networks onto individual computers for use .
In this model , individual computer users can always gain access to the latest programmes and do not need to store more software than they are currently using on their computers at any one time , also saving costs of memory and storage .
Chris Zuleeg , a veteran of Apple and a former JavaSoft marketing manager , is vice president of marketing at Internet Startup , whose Web site is www.internetstartup.com .
Bessemer has funded numerous Internet pioneers , including PSI Net , VeriSign and Individual .

MOTORCYCLING - JAPANESE WIN BOTH ROUND NINE SUPERBIKE RACES .
SUGO , Japan <number>
Teenager Yuuichi Takeda , racing in only his first season , outclassed the big names to win the first race in round nine of the world superbike championship on Sunday .
Takeda , <number> , showed poise far beyond his years to overtake Australian Ducati rider Troy Corser , last year 's championship runner-up , with four of the <number> laps left .
Honda 's Takeda was pursued past Corser by the Yamaha duo of Noriyuki Haga and Wataru Yoshikawa with Haga briefly taking the lead in the final chicane on the last lap .
But Takeda found one more spurt of power to just take the flag first with Haga second and Yoshikawa third .
Haga had the consolation of recording the fastest lap at <number> kph .
Corser , who crashed during practice on Friday , limped in fourth , four seconds behind Takeda with championship leader Aaron Slight of New Zealand <number> seconds behind the winner .
In the second race , Takeda again challenged strongly until the fifth lap from the end when he crashed while running second to eventual race winner Takuma Aoki .
Aoki , the elder brother of reigning <number> world champion Haruchika , had a race-long duel with John Kocinski of the United States on a Ducati before taking the chequered flag .
Kocinski led for the early laps before he was passed first by Aoki , who recorded the fastest lap of <number> kph , and then by Takeda .
With Takeda out of the race , Kocinski regained second place but he could not overtake Aoki .
Haga again was the unlucky rider finishing third ahead of Slight with Corser in <number> place .
But the strong showing by the Japanese riders did not alter the championship table with Slight still leading on <number> points , followed by Corser with <number> and Kocinski with <number> .

CRICKET - RUN-OUT GIVES LEWIS AND ENGLAND SLIM SATISFACTION .
LONDON <number>
Chris Lewis did his best to forget his controversial omission from the England one-day squad on Sunday but could not prevent Pakistan reasserting their dominance in the final test at The Oval .
A super piece of fielding by Lewis , dropped as a disciplinary measure after arriving only <number> minutes before the start on the fourth morning , provided the only bright spot for England as the touring team batted on to reach <number> for five at the interval , a lead of <number> .
The solitary wicket to fall was Asif Mujtaba , run out for <number> attempting a second run to third man where Lewis was lurking with a point to prove .
There seemed scant danger until the Surrey player swooped on to the ball and returned off balance to county team mate Alec Stewart who whipped off the bails .
Lewis , though , could not make similar waves with the ball as Salim Malik and Wasim Akram batted through the rest of the session with few alarms .
Wasim rattled along to <number> not out , outscoring his partner who was unbeaten on <number> at the break , although the weather was again threatening to play the dominant role .
Rain arrived just as the players left the field for lunch , forcing the ground-staff into action yet again .
The weather delayed the resumption for over an hour , the umpires finally announcing play would start again at <number> local time ( <number> GMT ) .

The victory , coming on the eve of the founding of the Florence club in <number> , also marked the first time since the pre-season trophy between the Cup winners and league champions was started in <number> that the Cup winners had won .

Montenegrin midfielder Dejan Savicevic equalised for the home team , weaving past a defender , checking and firing in a left-footed shot in the <number> minute that gave young Fiorentina goalkeeper Francesco Toldo little chance .
The scored stayed level to the final minutes but with a penalty shoot out looming , Batistuta took charge .
French international midfielder Marcel Desailly fouled the Argentine , whose coach at Boca Juniors before he joined Fiorentina in <number> was new Milan coach Oscar Tabarez , and Batistuta rammed home the free kick from <number> metres out .
The <number> minute shot , curling over the defence and dipping in under the bar from the striker dubbed Batigol by adoring Fiorentina fans , was just reward for Fiorentina who looked a far more impressive team .
Milan 's player of the year George Weah missed a good first half opportunity but otherwise looked a little rusty while Italian team mate Roberto Baggio did not play due to injury .
New Dutch signing Edgar Davids came on late in the second half as a Milan substitute but made little impact .

RUGBY UNION - All Blacks relive triumph .
PRETORIA , Aug <number> - Captain Sean Fitzpatrick and his All Blacks revisited the test venue today to relive some of the magic moments of yesterday 's momentous rugby victory over South Africa , NZPA reported .
Most of the test <number> who beat the Springboks <number> to secure New Zealand 's first-ever rugby series in South Africa stood in the middle of the empty <number> Loftus Versfeld .
Magnificent , ' ' said Fitzpatrick , New Zealand 's most capped player and the world 's most capped forward .
The players relived the moves and tries , the tackles and what might have been as the emotions of victory continued .
Zinzan Brooke , the only No <number> in test rugby to have scored a dropped goal when he kicked a three-pointer against England during last year 's World Cup , added a second to his name yesterday .
I was right here , ' ' he said standing at the spot where he had received the ball for the kick .
The maul was there and I was going to go in but I thought I should hold off because we had the ball .
When ( halfback ) Justin Marshall got the ball he was going to go on the openside where Jon Preston was so I emptied my lung at him to get the ball this way .
I just hit through and I was punching the air before the ball got there .
It cost me a few bucks at the bar . '
'
The decision to attempt a dropped goal was a spontaneous one , Brooke said .
It was just like the World Cup , the ball came and the chance was there . '
'
Centre Frank Bunce said he had never felt so exhausted during a match .
We were gutted and there was nowhere to hide , they just kept coming at you , ' ' he said .
I was gone in the first <number> minutes , completely exhausted , but you had no choice .
There was just so much riding on it .
It 's amazing just how big this ground was yesterday . '
'
Two-try winger Jeff Wilson said he was so tired that he kept asking Bunce where he should be while defending .
He told me I 'm buggered too so just hang in there ' , ' ' Wilson recalled .
About <number> New Zealander supporters were partying into the early hours of today in the South African capital .
Messages of goodwill continued to roll into the team hotel .
All Blacks coach John Hart said Prime Minister Jim Bolger rang him today to offer his congratulations .
He thanked us on behalf of the country , which is really nice for the team , and I understand we had tremendous support at home . '

South Africa yet to hear from apartheid enforcers .
Anton Ferreira
CAPE TOWN <number>
South Africa 's truth commission begins issuing subpoenas this week in a bid to dig beneath the political rationales and find the sinister figures who have the blood of the country 's race war on their hands .
Leaders of the major parties involved , from right-wing whites to radical blacks , appeared before Archbishop Desmond Tutu 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission last week to paint the broad picture of their actions for or against apartheid .
Most , including former president F.W. de Klerk and African National Congress Deputy President Thabo Mbeki , offered apologies for any mistakes they had made and accepted broad responsibility for the actions of their foot soldiers .
But none named those guilty of ordering or carrying out any of the gross violations of human rights which Tutu is investigating .
Human rights lawyer Brian Currin said the hearings last week were not intended as a form of confessional and that those who personally committed crimes during apartheid would testify only before a separate arm of the commission , the amnesty committee .
" I do n't think one should have expected more than what one got , " he said . "
That was not the amnesty committee where perpetrators are expected to open their hearts and souls and to tell it all . "
The commission , which has the power to grant amnesty to those who confess to abuses , has begun hearing the testimony from people already in jail for their deeds .
But others , such as self-confessed secret police hit-squad leader Dirk Coetzee , have yet to testify .
Tutu 's deputy chairman , Alex Boraine , told reporters the commission would begin issuing subpoenas to suspects who refused to appear voluntarily some time this week .
He added that former hardline apartheid president P.W. Botha could be among those called .
But Currin , who is advising several people regarded as perpetrators , said this was not the best way to achieve the commission 's aims .
" A person can be forced to appear , but the only way one is going to get to the truth in its totality is if people feel it is a good idea to go to the amnesty committee .
At the moment this is not the case . "
He cited Coetzee , who was charged with murder after confessing in media interviews to dirty tricks .
His trial is due to start in December but the truth commission intends to decide on his amnesty application before that .
Currin said the law had to be changed so all judicial prosecutions were automatically suspended for those who approached the truth commission .
Last week 's submissions to the commission by the ANC , de Klerk 's National Party and the right-wing Freedom Front of General Constand Viljoen left many South Africans unsatisfied .
Boraine said the picture was incomplete because officers of the apartheid-era security forces had yet to make their scheduled , separate submission , but one black caller to a radio talk show declared :
" This whole thing is utterly useless , it does n't help us at all .
What the people expect is to have houses , to have jobs . "
Political scientist Jannie Gagiano said he doubted that the National Party , which implemented apartheid in <number> and began dismantling it in <number> , felt it carried a burden of guilt and needed to be exculpated through the commission .
" Therefore I have some doubts about achieving some form of reconciliation .
One has to feel a bit guilty to feel the need for reconciling yourself to a historical adversary , " he said .
Professor Tom Lodge of the University of the Witwatersrand demurred , saying :
" In the irritation , in the jokes , in the anger that white South Africans express about the commission , I think there 's a moral uneasiness , and I think that 's healthy .
Responsibility is percolating downwards . "

Moslem refugees seek to vote in Serb-held town .
Samir Arnaut
MATUZICI , Bosnia <number>
Thousands of Moslem refugees denounced Bosnia 's elections as a farce on Sunday because Serb incomers would be able to vote in their old home town , cementing partition of the country .
They said they were ready to force their way back across post-war ethnic lines to Serb-held Doboj , one of several towns where NATO troops fear violence involving refugees determined to vote where they once lived .
The refugees , rallying in Matuzici on government territory two km from Doboj in northeast Bosnia , waved banners calling the polls a farce staged by the United Nations and the European Union . "
We demand to vote in Doboj , " other banners said .
Bosnia 's Moslem-led central government and many displaced Moslems are angered by a key provision of the Western-organised September <number> elections allowing people to vote in post-war " new places of residence . "
As a result , separatist Serb authorities have packed former Moslem majority towns with refugees of their own or registered other Serbs to vote there .
Critics say that what was billed as an electoral process to reintegrate Bosnia as a single , multi-ethnic state is shaping up as a referendum on partition , de facto or de jure .
" Only our physical presence in Doboj will mean that the Dayton peace treaty has truly been implemented , " Edhem Efendija Camdzic , Doboj 's Islamic imam-in-exile , told the refugees .
" The main point of this rally is to highlight to the world powers what misfortune they brought upon us , " said Reuf Mehemdagic , head of Doboj municipality-in-exile .
" Eleven thousand Serbs who came from elsewhere to Doboj will vote there .
How can we then expect the reintegration of Bosnia ?
But no one will stop us from returning to our homes . "
Mirhunisa Komarica , a government refugee official , said : " We want to vote where we were thrown out from .
This is a protest of warning and the next step is entering our town using all means possible , so let them shoot . "
Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic , a Moslem , told the refugees : " We have a message for the Serbs who are now in our homes not to plan the future of their children there because there will be no good fortune in that . "
To loud applause , he added : " We will enter Doboj , untie the Doboj knot and ensure free movement for all .
We have to enter Doboj to free the Serbs from their own ( separatist ) politics . "
The Dayton peace accords guaranteed refugees the right to return to their homes and ensured freedom of movement across ethnic lines .
But local police , controlled by nationalist parties in Moslem , Serb and Croat sectors of Bosnia , and civilian mobs have turned ceasefire lines into virtually impassable borders .
The majority of refugees from Bosnia 's <number> war are Moslems from the Serb-controlled north and east .
NATO-led peace troops beefed up their presence in the Doboj area on Sunday to deter any sudden emotional attempt by the refugees to cross the Inter-Entity Boundary Line into Doboj .
But the crowd dispersed without incident .
Moslems and Serbs have scuffled several times along the line in the past when Moslem refugees tried to surge into the town .

Russian troops start pullout , but not in Grozny .
SHATOI , Russia <number>
Russian troops began to pull out from southern Chechnya on Sunday under a ceasefire agreement between Russian security chief Alexander Lebed and rebel leaders .
But in the capital Grozny , the commander of Russian Interior Ministry forces in Chechnya , General Anatoly Shkirko , told Interfax news agency he was delaying a pullout of troops there after a group of Chechens disarmed an armoured column .
Reuters cameraman Liutauras Stremaitis said a column of around <number> vehicles , including tanks , armoured personnel carriers , artillery cannons and lorries , escorted by Chechen rebels , pulled out of the village of Shatoi towards the border , around <number> km ( <number> miles ) to the north .
In Grozny , Shkirko told Interfax he was suspending the pullout of troops from the capital until weapons seized by the Chechens were returned .
Chechen rebel spokesman Movladi Udugov confirmed the weapons had been seized but that it was a maverick group of Chechens .
He said later that the rebels had handed them over .
The pullout of the Russian troops is a key element of the peace plan brokered by Lebed , which aims to end the <number> Chechnya conflict .

Leftist Mexican armed group says troops in capital .
MEXICO CITY <number>
The leftist Popular Revolutionary Army ( EPR ) in a published report on Sunday said it operated throughout Mexico , including the capital , and denied government assertions it was isolated to one state .
Commanders " Vicente " and " Oscar " , guarded by a dozen EPR gunmen , said in an interview with La Jornada outside Mexico City that the armed group was committed to overthrowing the government .
" They ( government officials ) want to present us before public opinion as a local problem , as just being from Guerrero and as irrational radicals , " Commander Oscar told La Jornada .
They said the ERP , whose fighters first appeared wearing military fatigues and brandishing assault rifles in the southwestern state of Guerrero on June <number> , had a <number> membership , but this could not be confirmed independently .
La Jornada also reported on Sunday that the Mexican Army has discovered a <number> , EPR manual detailing guerrilla tactics and strategies .
It quoted the manual as saying : " The objective of the Basic Course on War is to provide for combatants of the EPR basic military knowledge for the armed conflict against the police and military apparatus of the bourgeoisie . "
It was the second time armed " commanders " of the EPR have granted interviews outside Guerrero state , an extremely poor and volatile region where leftist protesters often have clashed violently with authorities .
Unlike the better known and unrelated Zapatista rebels in southeastern Chiapas state , the EPR has never taken on the army in direct combat , according to official reports .
There have only been a few skirmishes in Guerrero in which a handful of police , soldiers and civilians have been killed or injured .

Two Thai border police wounded by Burma gunmen .

Two Thai border policemen were seriously wounded on Sunday when members of a Burmese rebel splinter faction ambushed their patrol in northwest Thailand , security officers said .
The two were wounded in the early hours of Sunday when some <number> members of the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army ( DKBA ) ambushed their patrol on the Thai side of the border with Burma , to the north of the town of Mae Sot .
The Thai army commander in the area , Col Suvit Maenmuan , told reporters the DKBA , which is allied with the Rangoon military government and based in southeast Burma , had recently stepped up cross-border infiltration .
Suvit said the motive for their intrusions was not clear but he had ordered reinforcements to beef up security along the porous frontier .
The DKBA was formed in late <number> by hundreds of guerrillas who split from the anti-Rangoon Karen National Union ( KNU ) and allied themselves with Burmese government army , their former enemies .
DKBA members have since launched intermittent cross-border attacks on Karen refugee camps in Thailand , where the majority of inhabitants are KNU supporters , and on Thai villages and police posts near the border .
Bangkok has complained to Rangoon about the raids but Burmese military authorities say they have no contol over the faction .
Thai army commanders reject the explanation , saying they have evidence the Burmese army supplies and directs the renegade ethnic minority splinter faction .

Egypt hopes jars will reveal secrets of mummies .
CAIRO <number>
Archaeologists in Egypt have found pots used by ancient Egyptians in burial rites that they say may reveal the secrets of mummification .
Mohammed Saleh , director of the Egyptian Museum , told Reuters television a U.S. team found the pots , some of which contain human intestines , in a tomb built into the rocks while digging in Dahshour , a village <number> km ( <number> miles ) south of Cairo .
Dahshour is the site of Egypt 's second largest pyramid , built for the pharaoh Seneferu more than <number> years ago .
Saleh said the team -- from New York 's Metropolitan Museum -- found four Canopic jars and two unguent jars in the tomb , which belongs to an unidentifed person who lived during the <number> Dynasty ( <number> BC ) in the Middle Kingdom .
" This finding is important because one of the jars still contains substances and materials used in the conservation of mummies and the conservation of the intestines and all the things which were in the cavity of a person we have not identified yet , " Saleh said .

Netanyahu , Weizman consult on Arafat invitation .

Israeli President Ezer Weizman , weighing a possible meeting with Yasser Arafat , consulted on Sunday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , a spokesman said .
Weizman and Netanyahu met at the president 's official Jerusalem residence and planned to speak to the media at the end of their talks , the prime minister 's spokesman said .
Earlier , the director of the president 's office denied a report in Israel 's Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper that Weizman had already invited Arafat to his private home for talks in the coming week on the future of the Israel-PLO peace process .
But the official , Aryeh Shumer , said it was only fitting that Weizman and Arafat should talk after the Palestinian leader sent the Israeli president a letter which Yedioth Ahronoth reported contained an emotional appeal to save the peace proces .
The newspaper said Netanyahu , who is cool to meeting Arafat himself , opposed talks between Weizman and the Palestinian president .
After Moslem suicide bombers killed <number> people in Israel in February and March , Weizman called for peace efforts with the PLO to be suspended .

Israeli President Ezer Weizman has invited Yasser Arafat to meet him at his private home , Israel 's biggest newspaper said on Sunday .
The Yedioth Ahronoth daily reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who has said he has no desire to hold talks with the Palestinian president , opposes the meeting due to be held this coming week .
The newspaper said Weizman scheduled the meeting at his private residence in the central Israeli village of Caesarea after Arafat sent him an emotional appeal " to save the peace process " .
Netanyahu met Weizman last Tuesday and voiced his opposition , Yedioth said .
" I am prepared to postpone the meeting under one condition -- that you give me a commitment right now to meet Arafat yourself within <number> days , " the paper quoted Weizman as telling Netanyahu .

What it comes down to is this : If you 're highly skilled , you 'll benefit nicely .
But if you 're not and cannot contribute to your employer 's goals , you 'll be paid less .
The survey , conducted in late <number> and the early part of this year by management consulting firm Towers Perrin , showed that the focus will be on an employee 's overall value to the company 's bottom line -- rather than how well an employee performs a specific task .
Presently , for example , if an accountant 's job involves doing five specific tasks , he or she can expect a certain salary , said Sandra O'Neal , a Towers Perrin principal .
In the future , the accountant will be evaluated solely on " knowledge , skill and abilities , " she said .
In addition to using accounting skills , the accountant will also have to be creative , work well in a team , be sensitive to customer needs and set productivity goals .
" The good news is , if you 're highly skilled and have many abilities , you 'll be paid more , " said O'Neal .
" The bad news is , if you 're not skilled and ca n't contribute to a team , to customer service and the organisation 's goals , you 'll be paid less . "
Of the <number> mid-to-large size corporations surveyed , <number> percent had undergone a major restructuring in the last three years , and more than two-thirds reported that productivity and profits were up as result .
Next on the agenda for these firms is developing a new compensation structure , and <number> percent report that they are considering a new , skills-based plan for both management and non-management employees .
This coming shift , O'Neal said , " is not just isolated or a fad .
It 's an inexorable change . "
After World War II , corporations adopted a " military model " creating hierarchical organisations where " the concept of defined tasks worked great , " she said .
But as the economy became global , customers were more demanding and problems became more complex .
" Multi-layers kept management at a distance from its customers , " O'Neal said .
Now organisations must change to stay competitive .
O'Neal says firms will place a greater emphasis on teams and team performance in giving raises .
If your team does well , you 'll do well .
If it does n't do well , do n't expect a raise .
Is this fair to an employee who can go the distance but is on a team that ca n't keep up ?
" That 's an important question we used to ask a lot , " said O'Neal . "
It 's not a question we ask any more .
The more important question is -- ' Do we have results ? '
"
To get those results , <number> percent of the companies surveyed plan to eliminate base pay increases in favour of cash bonuses and incentives , such as employee and team award programmes and education .
Companies that can change their culture and view employees as business partners will do well , O'Neal said .
For example , the survey rated some participants in the survey as " high-performing " companies , based on their return on equity above <number> percent .
Those companies also said they already offer employees variable pay and business education , give their managers more control over pay decisions and celebrate employee and team success .
" They respect employees more , they trust employees more and they value their employees more , " O'Neal said .
" The key to success at high-performance companies is engaging employees in a business partnership .
It will improve a company 's bottom line . "

Belgian police arrest detective in Dutroux affair .
Geert de Clercq
NEUFCHATEAU , Belgium <number>
Investigators arrested a senior police detective on Sunday in connection with their inquiries into Belgium 's child sex scandal , Public Prosecutor Michel Bourlet said .
" Georges Zicot was arrested and will be charged with truck theft , insurance fraud and document forgery , " Bourlet told a news conference .
He said there had been searches at three sites on Sunday , including one at the Charleroi judicial police headquarters where Zicot worked .
Zicot , <number> , is a specialist in tackling vehicle theft .
Belgian media reported that he had been questioned twice in the past two years about thefts but released both times .
He was promoted to chief detective earlier this year .
Bourlet said two other people had also been arrested .
One was Gerard Pignon , the owner of a warehouse where stolen vehicles were allegedly stored .
The other was insurer Thierry Dehaan .
Bourlet said the investigation into the vehicle theft ring would be added to the inquiry into the paedophile sex scandal in which five other people have already been arrested .
He said the connection was through Bernard Weinstein , an accomplice of convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux -- the central figure in the paedophile scandal that has sent shockwaves across Europe .
Weinstein was found dead last weekend alongside the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo in a house belonging to Detroux , who said they starved to death earlier this year , nine months after being abducted in June <number> .
Two other girls have been rescued and police are hunting for at least two more who Dutroux has admitted kidnapping a year ago .
" Dutroux has admitted killing Weinstein after a disagreement between the accomplices in an affair of truck theft , " Bourlet said .
Another four people were also questioned at the weekend but had not been detained , Bourlet added .
Anne Thily , public prosecutor in the eastern city of Liege where Julie and Melissa lived , said this was a major case involving some <number> investigators -- including two from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation .

North Afghan highway opening put off , radio says .
ISLAMABAD <number>
The planned reopening of Afghanistan 's main northern Salang highway as a result of peace talks with an opposition alliance has been put off until Wednesday , official Kabul Radio said on Sunday .
The embattled Afghan government said last week that the Kabul-Salang highway would be opened on Monday or Tuesday following talks with the Supreme Coordination Council alliance led by Jumbish-i-Milli movement of powerful opposition warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum .
The radio said on Sunday the postponement of the opening had been made due to " precautions " .
It did not elaborate .
The Salang highway , Afghanistan 's main route to Central Asia , has been controlled by Dostum since he began fighting President Burhanuddin Rabbani 's government in Kabul in January <number> in alliance with Hezb-i-Islami party leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , then prime minister but rival to the president .
Hekmatyar rejoined the government as prime minister last June under a peace pact with Rabbani and has since been trying to persuade other opposition factions to follow suit .
Earlier this month , Jumbish denied a Kabul government statement that the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire in the north .

Students burn Hasina effigy , battle police .
Anis Ahmed
DHAKA <number>
Students backed by opposition parties battled police and burned an effigy of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina during a strike in the north Bangladeshi town of Bogra on Sunday .
The strikers barricaded streets , attacked the local office of the ruling Awami League , fought running battles with police and set alight hundreds of copies of the popular " Janakantha " newspaper , alleging it was pro-government .
Police used batons and teargas to try to disperse students who were throwing stones and home-made bombs , witnesses said .
The strike , called by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP ) , to denounce the deaths of four students killed by police over the last few days , coincided with a visit to the area by Hasina .
Local officials said one policeman was killed by gunshots during clashes with pro-opposition students on Thursday .
Hasina told a cross section of people at the Bogra police headquarters on Sunday that the government had already suspended three police officers and ordered a judicial probe into the violent incidents .
The prime minister offered financial grants to the families of those killed , ordered the best possible medical care for the injured and urged Bogra residents to call off the strike .
Opposition legislators walked out of parliament in Dhaka on Sunday denouncing " unprecedented police barbarity " against opposition students and supporters .
They renewed their call for the resignation of Home ( Interior ) Minister Rafiqul Islam .
Hundreds of police raided the Dhaka university on Sunday , arresting nearly <number> outsiders who had been living in student dormitories and seizing weapons , university officials said .
Police stormed ten residence halls on the campus , flushed out people at gunpoint and searched their baggage .
They seized revolvers , sawn-off rifles , shotguns and knives .
The students were later allowed to return .
The swoop followed the resignation of the university 's Vice-Chancellor Dr. Emajuddin Ahmed on Saturday over the deteriorating law and order situation on the campus .
Authorities closed down the <number> university on Wednedsay following gunbattles between students and police .
Police said they fought armed activists from the BNP , headed by former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia .
Hasina told police the home ministry had already given a " blanket order " to arrest terrorists and possessors of illegal firearms irrespective of their political identities .
Nearly <number> students have been injured in the clashes in Dhaka and Bogra , police told reporters .

FEATURE - Fertile Ukraine faces drought of cash and rain .
Irene Marushko
BATKIVSHCHYNA COLLECTIVE FARM , Ukraine <number>
Four shiny new green-and-yellow John Deere combines parked at this <number> ( <number> ) farm in the grain-growing regions south of Kiev do n't fill its chief agronomist with enthusiasm .
" They did a good job this year , but they need good diesel and good engine oil , " said Ivan Odnosum . "
God help us if there is a breakdown , " he said of the machinery , loaned to the farm after the Ukrainian government bought it earlier this year .
The country 's grain harvest this year is forecast to fall by more than <number> percent to only <number> million tonnes and two harsh factors are to blame .
A drought scoured the steppes in May and June , stunting the growing wheat .
And the farming sector , making the painful transition from Soviet central planning to a market economy simply has no money .
Ukraine 's black soil is so fertile that a diplomat described it as " rich enough to grow rubber boots " .
But recently Ukraine has been losing its reputation as a breadbasket of Europe , earned in the years before brutal forced collectivisation under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin .
" The wheat will not be of a good quality this year , " said Hryhory Borsuk , a scientist at the Mironivka Wheat Institute , run by the Ukrainian Academy of Agrarian Sciences .
" The temperature on the ground reached <number> decrees Celsius ( <number> Fahrenheit ) this summer .
We 've never seen anything so bad , " he said in an interview in his office , unlit since the government cut off electricity because of unpaid power bills .
The harvest is gathered in the dry areas , but rainfall in Western Ukraine has delayed harvesting there .
While Mironivka 's scientists , some unpaid for months , carry on developing new strains of wheat resistant to Ukraine 's extreme continental climate , Borsuk said the lack of cash in Ukraine 's agricultural sector is as bad as the drought .
Collective farms and Ukraine 's nascent private farming sector have no money for fertiliser , no money for herbicides and pesticides , no money to repair old or buy new machinery , no money for fuel , and none to buy good seed .
This year 's harvest is down from last year 's <number> million tonne harvest , which in turn compares with <number> million tonnes in <number> , the year before independence .
The decline is all the worse for people who recall wasteful Soviet times , when the Kremlin imported grain but priced bread so cheaply that people bought it to feed their pigs .
" Agriculture is very expensive , and there are no solutions to our problems on the horizon , " said Odnosum .
He said his farm , its <number> workers now readying the fields for winter wheat sowing , expected the land to yield <number> tonnes per hectare ( <number> acres ) but ended up with <number> tonnes -- still better than the national average of <number> tonnes per hectare this year .
" We did not have money for fertiliser , we 're in debt for fuel , and we 're borrowing diesel , " Odnosum said .
A few kilometres ( miles ) down the two-lane road which passes Odnosum 's farm , where the occasional horse-drawn buggy passes by , is the <number> ( <number> ) Shevchenko collective farm , built next to a village still neat and tidy despite post-Soviet decay .
Chief Accountant Natalya Sypron said the collective is strapped for cash , earlier this year bartering <number> tonnes of grain for diesel to fuel six rickety grain combines and tractors badly in need of repairs and basic maintenance .
The average family earns <number> million karbovanets a year ( $ <number> - $ <number> ) -- but many have not been paid in months , Soprun said . "
People are working out of their own dedication . "
Borsuk said the farm sector has two options : " We can sit down and cry , or we can do something . "
He said the government plans to increase the sowing of the winter wheat which will be harvested next year .
Planted in late summer and early autumn , the grain is Ukraine 's largest export item and traditionally grows better than summer wheat in Ukraine 's soil .
Further plans , he said , called for full provision of resources like fertiliser and herbicides for <number> percent of Ukraine 's arable land next year , for <number> percent in <number> and <number> percent of the land in <number> .
" If we follow this we 'll be able to sell <number> million tonnes of grain by the year <number> , " Borkus said .
The government has been trying to phase out huge subsidies to the farm sector , and in a move back to pre-Soviet days has given up to <number> hectares ( <number> acres ) of land to some <number> private farmers willing to go it alone .
Collective farms will last for the next few years , because most private farms now only produce enough to feed themselves with maybe a little extra to sell , said one private farmer : " In the future , maybe , but it 's better not to hurry .
" Collectivisation brought us a lot of pain .
And it went too fast .
Privatising too quickly can also have a negative outcome . "

Gencor swells profit despite setbacks .
Melanie Cheary
JOHANNESBURG <number>
Gencor Ltd on Monday said it had swelled its year attributable profit and streamlined operations to strengthen it for the current financial year despite a variety of divisional setbacks .
Announcing the group 's results for the year ended June <number> , chairman Brian Gilbertson said : " Happily the strong improvement in financial performance is not an illusion arising from the recent weakness of the rand relative to the dollar . "
Gencor raised attributable earnings to <number> million rand from <number> million rand previously - in dollar terms an increase to $ <number> million from $ <number> million - and won despite the group 's Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd posting dismal results .
" Not everything has gone well .
We 've had substantial production difficulties at a number of our operations .
The most obvious one with the greatest effect on the corporation was at Impala where we had the furnace failure , " Gilbertson said .
Implats posted year attributable profit of <number> million rand from <number> million previously .
Not only did the company lock in <number> rand per dollar in February / March , but it suffered output losses due to a furnace shutdown last August .
The rand was last bid at <number> against the dollar .
Nor was Implats the only operation to fail output targets .
Ingwe Coal Corporation Ltd was hit hard by heavy rains .
It forfeited nearly one million tonnes of production to flooding at its mines in Mpumulanga province .
But Gilbertson said the greatest gloom in the year came from the European Commission 's blocking of Implats ' proposed merger with Lonrho Plc 's platinum interests .
" The big disappointment for the year was the failure of the platinum merger .
From Gencor 's perspective we are taking the position that it is not on , " Gilbertson said .
Looking ahead to the current financial year , he said that Gencor would boost earnings further .
" Gencor is well placed to take up the challenges of the future .
The group is soundly structured and prudently financed and is blessed with an excellent portfolio of world-class businesses .
I think we can look forward to further growth " .
Citing the disposal of Gencor 's stake in industrial holdings group Malbak Ltd for one billion rand among other smaller disposals , Gilbertson said Gencor had pruned its portfolio to concentrate on core assets .
" We 've tried to clean up our overall portfolio by disposing of non-core assets .
The biggest of those was Malbak .
Overall a very substantial pruning ...
leaving Gencor clearly structured along commodity lines , " Gilbertson said .
He added that the group still had about <number> million rand after tax invested in various shares , which were market for disposal when required .
Referring to Gencor 's increased <number> percent stake in Ingwe , Gilbertson said the group would wait for coal shares to be cheaper before considering snapping up more .
" I think we would have liked to have more of Ingwe but it 's the question of adding value .
When we bought the shares we bought ...
at quite a bit lower than the price is now ...
maybe if we just wait another few years for the next downturn in coal . "
Finally , Gilbertson said a growing proportion of Gencor 's income was coming from offshore and unlisted investments .

SOCCER - SEYCHELLES FAIL IN BID FOR HISTORIC VICTORY .
Mark Gleeson
JOHANNESBURG <number>
The tiny islands of the Seychelles failed to make soccer history at the weekend when they bowed out of the preliminary rounds of the African Nations Cup .
Trailing fellow Indian Ocean islanders Mauritius <number> from the first leg , they were held to a <number> draw at home on Saturday despite playing against <number> men for most of the match .
The <number> aggregate took Mauritius into the group phase of the qualifiers for the <number> finals , and kept up the Seychelles ' record of never having won an official match in their <number> years of FIFA membership .
The Seychelles must have thought they were on course for a historic breakthrough when Mauritian midfielder Andre Caboche was sent off for a crude tackle in the <number> minute .
But the visitors responded to the setback immediately -- veteran striker Ashley Mocude scoring a minute later to give them a two-goal aggregate lead .
Although Danny Rose 's <number> equaliser gave the Seychellois renewed hope they could not find the net again and were eliminated .
Mauritius now play in group seven of the qualifiers against Malawi , Mozambique and favourites Zambia .
Namibia , who drew <number> with Botswana in their first leg , won the second leg in Windhoek <number> to stretch their unbeaten run to eight matches and continue their remarkable progress on the African soccer stage .
They now play in group five with Cameroon , Gabon and Kenya .
German-based striker Bachirou Salou returned home to Togo to score the decisive only goal of their tie against Congo .
Salou , who plays for MSV Duisburg in the Bundesliga , scored in the <number> minute of Sunday 's match in Lome for a <number> aggregate win which takes his side into group six , where they will meet Liberia , Tanzania and Zaire .
Ethiopia needed a penalty shoot-out in Addis Ababa to overcome Uganda after a <number> aggregate scoreline .
Both legs ended <number> before Ethiopia won the spot kick decider <number> .
Uganda 's elimination follows their humiliating <number> aggregate defeat by Angola in June 's World Cup qualifying preliminaries .

SWIMMING - POPOV IN `SERIOUS CONDITION ' AFTER STABBING .
MOSCOW <number>
Russian double Olympic swimming champion Alexander Popov was in a serious condition on Monday after being stabbed on a Moscow street .
A doctor said it was too early to say whether Popov , the only man to retain the Olympic <number> and <number> metres freestyle titles , would return to top-level sport .
" His condition is serious , " said Rimma Maslova , deputy chief doctor of Hospital No <number> in the Russian capital . "
But he is conscious and is talking and smiling . "
Maslova told Reuters she was not an expert in sports medicine , but said it was too early to judge Popov 's chances of returning to competitive swimming .
Popov , who won gold in the <number> and <number> metres freestyle at the recent Atlanta Olympics , was stabbed in the abdomen late on Saturday after an argument with a group of roadside watermelon sellers in south-west Moscow .
Maslova said the wound had affected a lung and a kidney .
Doctors operated on Popov , <number> , for three hours .
Popov told NTV television on Sunday he was in no danger and promised he would be back in the pool shortly . "
There 's no need to worry .
We 're going to be walking soon -- and swimming , " he insisted cheerfully from his bed in the intensive care unit .
Interfax news agency said police had detained one of the attackers .
It said the row started when Popov and a group of his friends were returning from a party .
Vitaly Smirnov , president of the Russian National Olympic Committee , said President Boris Yeltsin had given the swimmer Russia 's top award for his Olympic performance . "
I am not a doctor but I think he is doing all right , " said Smirnov .
Smirnov said the Olympic Committee might ask the government to take measures to protect the country 's best athletes , some of whom have already chosen to live abroad for fear of a surge in crime in post-Soviet Russia .

SOCCER - PLAYERS LEAVE MATCH EARLY TO CATCH PLANE .
Brian Homewood
RIO DE JANEIRO <number>
Two key players left a Brazilian championship match early on Sunday because they had to catch a plane to Russia to play with the national team .
Sao Paulo midfielder Andre and Santos defender Narciso were both substituted during their teams ' game , taken to Sao Paulo airport and flown to Rio de Janeiro in a private jet chartered by the Brazilian Football Confederation ( CBF ) .
At Rio , they joined up with the national team squad for the journey to Moscow , where Brazil will face Russia in a friendly international on Wednesday .
The problem arose because the Sao Paulo-Santos clash was selected as the day 's televised live match , forcing it to be put back three hours from the usual kickoff time .
Santos suffered more from their loss as Narciso 's replacement Jean gave away a penalty from which Sao Paulo scored the decisive goal in a <number> win .
Sao Paulo lead the first stage of the championship on goal difference from surprise package Juventude , who beat Internacional <number> .
Corinthians , who played in a tournament in Spain last week , also faced a plane marathon as they attempted to keep up with a hectic fixture list .
They were due to leave Spain Monday night , arrive in Sao Paulo on Tuesday morning , catch another plane to the southern city of Curitiba one hour later and then play away to Atletico Paranaense in the Brazilian championship the same evening .
Botafogo striker Tulio , who was overlooked by Zagalo for the tour which also features a game away to the Netherlands on Sunday , scored his third goal in three games as the defending champions beat Bahia <number> away .
Tulio , who has been top-scorer in the competition for the last two seasons , has been struggling against injury for most of this year .

TENNIS - QUENCH YOUR THIRST - IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT AT U.S. OPEN .
Bill Berkrot
NEW YORK <number>
A message on television monitors all around the National Tennis Centre reads : " Due to hot weather please seek shade and drink plenty of fluids " -- sound advice until you check out the price of fluids .
Perhaps the advisory was cut off before concluding : " ...and bring plenty of money . "
A small bottle of a garishly-coloured sports drink at the sun-drenched U.S. Open is going for $ <number> , while a litre of basic , life-sustaining water will set you back $ <number> -- for water ?
" At the Olympics water was only a dollar , and that was the Olympics , " said one incredulous fan , noting that the Atlanta Games had been notorious for price gouging .
U.S. Open officials managed to insult most of the male tennis players last week with their controversial handling of the seeding and draw .
When the tournament began on Monday it was the fans ' turn to be offended .
" That baked lasagna better be good for $ <number> , " said New Yorker Rebecca Weinstein , a U.S. Open regular who was eating a sandwich she had brought from home .
A trio of hungry fans at the food court who had already forked over the lasagna money pronounced it good , but Carol Perry chimed in , " The water is ridiculous , they want four dollars for the water , you might as well get a glass of wine . "
Indeed , a nice glass of chardonnay or white zinfandel was going for $ <number> , while an imported beer was just a bit more than the water at $ <number> .
What 's the message here ? "
Maybe they want us to be alcoholics , " Perry joked before lifting her glass of wine .
Fans will be shelling out $ <number> for a hamburger and a large french fries .
And that little snack is guaranteed to make you thirsty .
Make that $ <number> .
Even a sandwich as pedestrian as a ham and swiss cheese is going for a whopping $ <number> .
Of course , it is served on a tuscan roll .
It must be the cost of flying those rolls over from Tuscany every day that drives up the price of the sandwich .

TENNIS - HUBER AND MALEEVA FALL , UP-AND-COMERS ADVANCE AT OPEN .
Larry Fine
NEW YORK <number>
Martina Hingis led a youthful charge and Australian Open finalist Anke Huber and Magdalena Maleeva were fallen seeds on Monday in a hot , sunny opening to the U.S. Open tennis championships .
The <number> Hingis , seeded <number> , was honoured to play the first match of the season 's last Grand Slam on Stadium Court but happy to hurry off with a straight-sets victory over the <number> Angeles Montolio of Spain .
" It was very hot and I did n't want to stay long on the court , " said a cheery Hingis , who had no worries in racing to a <number> <number> victory against the overmatched Spaniard .
Hoping for a longer engagement on the cement at Flushing Meadows were the sixth-seeded Huber of Germany and <number> seed Maleeva of Bulgaria .
Huber , who lost to Monica Seles in the Australian Open final , fell victim to an unfortunate draw in bowing to dangerous floater Amanda Coetzer of South Africa .
Coetzer , ranked <number> , avenged her defeat to Huber in the Australian Open semifinals by winning <number> <number> <number> .
" I looked at it as not a first round match , just a great challenge for me , " said Coetzer , <number> . "
I was really concentrating on keeping my own momentum and my own rhythm .
" She is tough to play in that way because she plays very up and down .
She played one great game and than a few errors .
The challenge was just for me to keep playing my own game . "
Huber , who reached the final a week ago at Manhattan Beach , could only mourn her luck of the draw .
" I was n't happy when I saw the draw .
She was the first non- seeded player , " said the <number> German . "
It 's always tough to play somebody like that in the first round in a Grand Slam .
" I think I did n't play that bad today .
It was maybe my best first round match in a Grand Slam I ever played . "
Monday brought the best out in U.S. Open rookie Aleksandra Olsza of Poland , ranked <number> .
The <number> Olsza , last year 's Wimbledon junior champion , celebrated her debut in the main draw of the Open by removing Maleeva <number> <number> .
The curtain-raising victories by Hingis and Olsza provided a ringing endorsement for the newest wave of women 's players coming up from the junior ranks .
The Swiss teenager , a twice French Open junior champion and a Wimbledon juniors winner , had already proven her main stage mettle by reaching the quarters at this year 's Australian Open .
" I hope I can get into the last <number> , " said Hingis , seeded to face third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the fourth round .
Hingis has been working hard on conditioning and has lost eight pounds ( <number> kilos ) in advance of the championships .
" There will be tough matches but I hope I can get there , " she said . "
Then we 'll see if Arantxa will be there , too . "
The fast-moving Olsza , <number> , was cool in her opening match .
" I was n't scared when I heard that I was playing Maleeva , " said Olsza . "
I know that if I want to play professional tennis I have to do my best to try to beat her and I ca n't be scared . "
Olsza is undaunted by the level of competition in the pros .
" In terms of tennis , I think the junior players are really good now .
In a few years , it could change a lot among the top players . "
Two big-serving women 's players made quick work of Japanese opponents .
Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of the Netherlands , the <number> seed , was a <number> <number> winner over Japan 's Nana Miyaga , while Czech veteran Helena Sukova prevailed over Yone Kamio <number> <number> .
Austrian Barbara Paulus , seeded <number> , also reached the second round with a <number> <number> victory over Yi Jing-Qian of China .

TENNIS - STICH GLAD HE STAYED AFTER OPEN VICTORY .
Richard Finn
NEW YORK <number>
Michael Stich nearly pulled out of the U.S. Open in protest over the men 's seeding fiasco but the former Wimbledon champion was glad he stayed after sweating out a four-set win on Monday over qualifier Tommy Haas .
" I still feel it 's embarrassing what happened and I was about to pull out yesterday and say , ' That 's it , ' " said Stich , one of a host of men who cried foul over seeding procedures that forced an unprecedented remaking of the men 's draw last week .
" But there are so many reasons to play , especially spectators and the kids who come out here and want to enjoy watching tennis , that I decided to stay . "
In a break from tradition , the Open did not seed in strict accordance with ATP rankings , instead taking into account other factors that raised objections of favourtism toward U.S. players .
One prominent player that did not stay for the Open was French Open champion Yvegeny Kafelnikov , who after being dropped three spots from his ATP ranking to a seventh seeding , withdrew and returned home to Russia .
Kafelnikov had pulled out of last week 's tournament with a rib injury .
At a news conference attended by approximately <number> players on Sunday , U.S. Davis Cup player Todd Martin expressed the players ' outrage at the seedings .
" The way the U.S. Open has seeded here , tampering with the ranking system , has tarnished the image and reputation of this U.S. Open in the players ' mind , and we think that is damaging to our sport , " Martin said .
Stich said he felt the players ought to have organised an active protest .
" I feel that we made it a little easy for the USTA .
They did n't really get hurt as much as I think they should have , " said Stich . "
I feel that we should have maybe just cancelled out the Monday , not show up today and start the tournament tomorrow . "
But once the <number> Stich got on the court , he focused his energies on trying to win the year 's last Grand Slam .
He took a positive first step with his <number> <number> <number> <number> win over compatriot Haas on a sun-baked Grandstand court .
Others advancing early on Monday included <number> American Malivai Washington , the Wimbledon runner-up , Sweden 's Magnus Gustafsson , and two-time former French Open champion Sergi Bruguera of Spain , who will be Stich 's next opponent .
The suspicion , however , lingers in Stich 's mind that U.S. Open officials did tamper with the seeding process in order to benefit homegrown players .
" I get the feeling that everything is done here for the American players and they forget about all the other players , " said Stich , who lost the <number> Open final to Andre Agassi .
It was Agassi who was at the centre of the controversy that engulfed the tournament since the original draw was completed on Wednesday .
The flamboyant American star was bumped up two spots from his ATP ranking of eight to a seeding of six .
" He ( Agassi ) should be seeded the way he is playing tennis right now , " said Stich about the unfairness of moving up Agassi , who made early exits from the French Open and Wimbledon .
Stich , not seeded here for the first time since <number> , might have benefitted from some fiddling with the seedings himself after Kafelnikov withdrew .
Ranked <number> in the world , Stich might have been slipped into that spot ahead of Spain 's Felix Mantilla , who is <number> but had never been played in the Open and had been left out of the seedings originally .
But Stich did n't want to play that game .
" I think he deserves to be seeded as everybody else who is in the top <number> deserves to be seeded , " Stich said .

OSCE delays decision on refugee voting .
Kurt Schork
SARAJEVO <number>
Bosnia 's election organisers will decide on Tuesday whether or not to postpone municipal elections scheduled as part of nationwide balloting , an OSCE spokeswoman said on Monday .
Officials from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) are considering the postponement following allegations of serious irregularities in the registration of Serb refugees .
International observers say the alleged irregularities could affect the outcome of voting for municipal assemblies .
" Tomorrow ...
the Provisional Election Commission will consider the possible postponement of municipal elections only ...
the other elections will be held on September <number> , " OSCE spokeswoman Agota Kuperman told reporters in Sarajevo .
" I think that it would be very difficult to select which municipal elections would have to be cancelled .
I think probably if the decision ( to cancell ) were to be taken it would probably be all municipal elections ..
. "
Kuperman added that options other than postponement were also on the table , but she refused to specify what they were .
The Dayton peace agreement gave the OSCE a mandate to organise Bosnian elections .
The Provisional Election Commission is OSCE 's top rule-making body for the poll .
More than <number> refugees have registered to vote in <number> countries around the world , representing about <number> per cent of Bosnia 's total electorate .
They are due to begin voting on Wednesday , August <number> , just one day after the PEC is supposed to make its decision .
Balloting inside Bosnia is scheduled for September <number> , when citizens are slated to elect municipal and cantonal assemblies , separate Moslem-Croat and Serb parliaments , a national House of Representatives and a three-man Presidency .
A Sarajevo daily newspaper , Dnevi Avaz , which is close to Bosnia 's Moslem nationalist SDA party , on Monday said the OSCE would postpone the municipal-level elections until the Spring of <number> because of the refugee registration problems .
SDA has a representative on the Provisional Election Commission .
" I do n't know what the source of the Dnevi Avaz report is , but it is consistent with what I have heard from western diplomats and from inside the OSCE , " said an OSCE staff member in Sarajevo who asked not to be named .
" The word is that Frowick has decided to postpone municipal elections but that he will wait for one more session of the PEC on Tuesday to take everyone 's temperature on the issue . "
Ambassador Robert Frowick , an American , heads the OSCE mission in Bosnia .
OSCE and independent monitors allege that Serb authorities have systematically discouraged refugees from registering to cast a ballot in the places they lived before the war .
Instead , the refugees were said to have been directed by their authorities to vote from strategic towns which had Moslem majorities before the <number> Bosnian war , but which are now underpopulated as a result of " ethnic cleansing " .
Diplomats explain the purpose of this electoral engineering is to secure Serb control over pivotal towns inside the <number> per cent of Bosnia known as the Serb republic , consolidating through the ballot box what was initially taken in war .
The top U.N. refugee official in the Balkans highlighted the voter registration problem on Monday .
" Results of the registration for September elections herald a dismal future for multi-ethnicity in Bosia-Hercegovina , " warned Soren Jessen-Petersen , Special Envoy for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Former Yugoslavia .
" In the run-up to elections , nationalistic political leaders are playing the ethnic / sectarian card , drumming up support within their constituencies by playing on bitter memories or fear . "

After truce , Lebed faces tougher Chechen problem .
Alastair Macdonald
MOSCOW <number>
Alexander Lebed may finally get to discuss his Chechen peace proposals with Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday after a lost weekend in the region when he was forced to abandon plans to sign a new political treaty with the separatist rebels .
It could be a sobering experience for the Kremlin security chief who , just two months after being appointed by the president and two heady weeks after taking charge of the Chechen crisis , had promised to wrap up the <number> war by the weekend .
Despite a mood of compromise in the region after some of the worst fighting of the war , Lebed may be just finding out that concluding a long-term settlement , somewhere between rebel demands for independence and Moscow 's insistence that Chechnya remain part of Russia , will be no easy matter .
A chain-smoking former paratroop general with a sharp line in deadpan putdowns and a soldier 's knack for making life sound simple , Lebed managed to arrange an ambitious ceasefire in the region last week , days after the Russian army threatened to bomb its way back into the rebel-held Chechen capital Grozny .
He returned at the weekend , pledging to conclude a political settlement that would make this truce work where all others have failed .
But then he apparently thought better of it .
Saying he needed to tidy up legal loose ends on the deal -- and also cover his back against unnamed pro-war schemers in Moscow -- he flew back to the capital empty-handed on Sunday .
He met Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday and , according to the press service of Lebed 's Security Council , could meet Yeltsin on Tuesday .
It was not clear if the start of Yeltsin 's holiday , announced later , would affect plans to talk .
Moscow 's as yet undisclosed proposals on Chechnya 's political future have , meanwhile , been sent back to do the rounds of various government departments .
It is not known what caused the delay in the peace plan .
Speculation mounted last week that Lebed was operating out on a limb in Chechnya as Yeltsin , hardly seen since his reelection last month , kept out of sight and then gave an interview criticising his envoy just as he clinched a truce .
But Chernomyrdin took pains at the weekend to insist Lebed was playing for a united team and that the proposals he took to rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov had been agreed by Yeltsin .
If that were the case , it was unclear why Lebed suddenly found it necessary to have the deal verified in Moscow .
Lebed himself said he was concerned that powerful interests in Moscow , who have profited from the war and want it to go on , would seize on any inadequacy in the deal to remove him .
Maskhadov warned that Lebed risked the same fate as a former Russian army commander in the region who sought a compromise and was blown up last year by -- so the Chechens say -- Russian forces .
Maskhadov may also have made new demands on Lebed , forcing him to check back with the Kremlin on what he could offer .
A rebel spokesman said the two military men had come close to agreement on a face-saving formula acceptable to both sides and involving a referendum on independence at some future date .
Chernomyrdin said voters should decide Chechnya 's future but stressed there was no question of the government letting the region quit the Russian Federation -- something Moscow fears could encourage separatist tendencies in other ethnic regions , particularly in the strategic North Caucasus .
Lebed may be be finding that closing that political gap between the two sides is more difficult than just ending a war .

Thousands of workers of Serbia 's Zastava arms factory entered the second week of protests on Monday over unpaid wages and the lack of a programme to revive the plant 's production .
" We are stubborn , have strength and time to persist until our demands are met , " said the factory 's trade union secretary Dragutin Stanojlovic .

In Kragujevac where the plant is based , <number> to <number> people gathered in the central square to express their bitterness at what Stanojlovic called government indifference .
The ruling Socialist Party last week accused Serbia 's opposition of stirring up social unrest and using workers ' already difficult social position for their own interests .
" Late wages , no work and ( the lack of a ) production programme are the main reasons for their protests , " a senior member of the local Socialist Party branch told Reuters .
" But there is a significant influence of opposition parties that are collecting points ahead of coming elections . "

" Under the law before launching the strike we have to sign an agreement with our employer for a minimal transport servicing of emergency flights , " Raichev said .
Raichev said a lock-out with military air controllers was impossible as they did not speak English .

Midwest direct cash hog prices Tuesday were seen steady following strong demand Monday that lifted prices as much as $ <number> per cwt in some areas , livestock dealers said .

Gore presents new image of lead attack dog .
Michael Posner
CHICAGO <number>
No more mild-mannered and meek Al Gore , the vice president and likely heir apparent to President Bill Clinton , emerged on Monday as the new Democratic attack dog leading a front-line assault on Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich .
While Clinton takes a train trip to the Democratic Convention that will renominate him on Wednesday for a second term , Gore is the bright star in the convention city now .
Crowds anxiously wait for his appearances , thrusting out hands for him to grip as they scream " <number> more years " -- a wishful hope to eight years of Gore after a Clinton re-election .
Over a <number> span from Sunday evening to Monday morning , so many people jammed Gore events that the fire marshal stopped members of Congress , reporters and others from entering a pro-Israel rally and a meeting of the New York delegation .
In his appearances , the often stiff and wooden Gore seemed transformed into a new energetic , gesturing " pol " as he ripped into Republican presidential nominee Dole and Gingrich , who has emerged as the favorite right-wing foil of Democrats .
Gore told a roaring labor rally of about <number> union workers that Dole and Gingrich were the virtual personifaction of evil , without even mentioning that former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp is Dole 's running mate .
" With equal measures of ignorance and audacity this two-headed monster of Dole and Gingrich has been launching an all out assault on decades of progress of behalf of working men and women , " Gore said to whoops of " <number> more years . "
" They want to drive you out of politics and they ca n't , " he added . "
They want to silence your voices in elections . "
At a downtown hotel Monday , the <number> Gore gave Wisconsin delegates a taste again of the new Gore .
" I want you to ask this question .
What would Wisconsin face if the same extremist coalition , the Gingrich / Dole Congress , also controlled the executive branch ? "
Gore said .
Noting the next presidential term will probably see two or three Supreme Court justice nominations , he warned , " Their extremist agenda would come out of the Gingrich Congress , into and through the Dole White House , down through the Supreme Court . "
He painted a scene of horrors he saw if Republicans controlled the White House and the Congress they hold now . "
Our personal and religious liberties would be at risk .
Medicare would be at risk of withering on the vine .
Medicaid would be at risk of being taken away from poor children .
Education would be at risk .
The environment would be at risk from the polluters that control that coalition , " he said .
His new style mixed an assault on Republicans with what he sees as " productive opportunity , a vision for the future that lifts up working families , that builds Wisconsin stronger , that builds America stronger .
With your help we can re-elect Bill Clinton . "
Dole 's tax cut plans were called " deja-voodoo economics .... It 's a warmed-over plan that failed and drove our economy into a ditch .
We got burned once and we wo n't let that happen to our nation again . "
Gore ridiculed Dole 's defense of the tobacco industry , praised Clinton for " courage " in advancing regulations of it .
To the delegates of Wisconsin , a leading dairy state , Gore had the right audience in poking fun at Dole 's comparison to addiction to tobacco to those who ca n't tolerate milk .
" Some people say milk is bad for you , " Gore said as Wisconsin delegates held aloft a plastic inflated cow .
He praised Clinton for vetoing the Republican Congress ' attempt to repeal parts of the Clean Air Act , and criticized Republicans for " slashing money to combat drugs in schools . "
" The choice has never been starker , the stakes today have never been higher , " Gore said . "
We 're not going to let them get away with that . "

Actor Reeve highlights Democrats ' first night .
CHICAGO <number>
The highlights of the first day of the Democratic convention on Monday were expected to feature a mix of party leaders and people who have overcome adversity .
Among the latter were gun control advocate Sarah Brady and actor Christopher Reeve and the politicians included Rep .
Richard Gephardt and Sen .
Thomas Daschle .
Here are thumbnail profiles of the convention 's key Monday speakers .
Sarah Brady -- The nation 's toughest gun control law is named after Ronald Reagan 's press secretary James Brady but it was his wife who was the major force behind its passage .
As head of Handgun Control Inc. , Sarah Brady , <number> , campaigned nonstop for tough gun control in the years following the shooting of her husband and then President Reagan in <number> .
Her reward was the passage in <number> of the " Brady Bill " which requires a mandatory five-day waiting period for purchase of handguns and also mandates background checks for would-be gun purchasers .
Reagan recovered fully from his wounds but Brady , who was close to death after being shot by John Hinckley Jr .
, suffered serious brain damage .
Sarah was Brady 's second wife and they have a son , James Scott Brady Jr .
Before the assassination attempt , she had worked for Republican congressmen and for the Republican Party .
Christopher Reeve -- Reeve was best known for playing the comic book hero Superman in four movies but his greatest heroics came in real life .
Reeve , an accomplished rider who owned several horses , suffered multiple injuries including two shattered neck vertebrae when he was thrown from his horse at an equestrian event in Culpepper , Virginia , on May <number> , <number> .
Almost entirely paralyzed , Reeve underwent extensive surgery to fuse the vertebrae to the base of the skull and prevent any further damage to his spine .
That allowed him to be moved to a semi-upright position .
Over time he regained the power of speech , so much so that he was asked to address the opening night of the Democratic National Convention .
Reeve , <number> , was classically trained as an actor but became the prototypical handsome leading man .
He performed in summer stock and soap operas before being plucked as an almost unknown to play the lead in " Superman " and three sequels .
Richard Gephardt -- Gephardt , House Democratic leader , is a politician with a " Mr Clean " reputation who sought the presidency eight years ago and is widely believed to still have ambitions for the job .
Gephardt , <number> , the son of a milkman from a working class district of St. Louis , is a consummate congressional insider , sufficiently skilled in compromise and the ways of the legislature to manage the often-unruly House Democrats .
A former lawyer , he was in the front line of President Bill Clinton 's battle with the Republican-led Congress over the budget but has opposed the president 's decision to sign the Republican-written welfare reform bill .
He advocated tough action against foreign countries to cut U.S. trade deficits but sometimes been out of step with the party 's liberal wing .
He was an opponent of abortion until <number> and voted for President Ronald Reagan 's big tax cut bill .
Gephardt , a red-haired square-jawed man , is a less than fiery orator .
His <number> bid for the Democratic nomination only took off after he recreated himself as a firebreathing reformer of the establishment , standing up for blue collar workers and farmers .
Tom Daschle -- Daschle , <number> , was largely unknown outside Washington and his state of South Dakota when he surprisingly beat more prominent rivals to become Senate Democratic leader after the party lost its majority to the Republicans in <number> .
A mild-mannered and youthful man who rose rapidly after entering the Senate in <number> , he presented himself as a Midwest moderate , as a Democratic winner in a Republican state able to unite Senate factions .
Concern that he might be steamrollered by the vastly more experienced Republican leader Bob Dole was dispelled when he showed a tough edge , outmaneuvering Dole in a wrangle over scrapping a gas tax and raising the federal minimum wage .
In his early Senate years he was seen as a " prairie populist " , working on legislation protecting farmers ' prices and also on compensating veterans sickened by Agent Orange defoliant spraying in the Vietnam War .
Daschle was a key player in President Bill Clinton 's failed attempt at sweeping healthcare changes but when he became minority leader he declared he would be no water-carrier for the White House .
He has made clear he opposed Clinton 's signing of the Republican-initiated welfare reform bill .
He has spent his adult life in politics , coming to Congress as an aide in <number> after three years in the Air Force and then being elected to the House of Representatives himself in <number> .

Eurograde barges were offered at $ <number> fob ARA for Amsterdam-Rotterdam barrels , and at $ <number> for full ARA material .
" There is no market at the moment , " one Rotterdam trader said . "
Maybe sentiment is a little bit weaker but prices have not changed . "
Outright gas oil prices were notionally softer as the NYMEX heating oil contract headed lower , and following news that the Indian Oil Corp ( IOC ) had issued a tender to buy only <number> tonnes of high speed diesel for October .
Asian traders had earlier expected an IOC tender for around <number> tonnes .
ARA gas oil barges were quiet although one trader said he had seen offers at $ <number> a tonne over September IPE for prompt barrels , while Antwerp material was available for <number> cents over September .
The IOC tender had " a bearish impact , but not a great impact , " one German player said .
Fuel oil markets were also listless .
Offers were around a dollar a tonne higher at $ <number> fob ARA but bids were scarce .

Chelsea makes political debut on Clinton train trip .
CHILLICOTHE , Ohio <number>
- Chelsea Clinton , until now carefully shielded from the exposure of public life , made her political debut on Sunday on her father 's whistlestop train trip .
Chelsea , <number> , was at President Bill Clinton 's side as he rode the rails through parts of West Virginia , Kentucky and Ohio , and was introduced at every stop .
She even worked ropelines , shaking hands with excited fans .
Hillary Rodham Clinton saw her husband and daughter off on the trip in Huntington , West Virginia and then went on to Chicago to begin a rigorous Democratic Convention schedule .
Asked if Chelsea would have a prominent role in the campaign , White House spokesman Mike McCurry said : " She 'll do what she did today when she can .
She has to go back to school . "
The president 's daughter is going into her senior year of high school at Sidwell Friends School , a private school in Washington .
McCurry said Chelsea has asked to go on the train trip and attend the convention where her father will be renominated , but said her exposure did not signal the start of a new political career .

Dutch closing share market report .

The AEX index of leading shares closed <number> points easier at <number> , the day 's low .
The Dutch market had been on the defensive all day but a softer start to Wall Street did little to boost sentiment in late trade , dealers said .

Tapie to quit French assembly seat as film opens .
PARIS <number>
Former businessman and soccer boss Bernard Tapie said that he would give up his seat in the National Assembly by Wednesday , the day a film by Claude Lelouche in which he stars opens in France .
" I will no longer be deputy by the time the film opens , " he said in a broadcast interview .
" Just about , " he told Europe <number> radio when asked whether he had sent his letter of resignation to Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin .
A Seguin spokeswoman confirmed that no letter or call had yet been received .
Tapie , <number> , was resigning just ahead of expected government action to eject him from the Assembly following a finding by the Supreme Court that he was bankrupt and thus ineligible for public office for a five-year period .
Tapie , the target of a blizzard of legal actions over his now-destroyed business empire and the Marseille soccer team he once ran , has a starring role in Lelouche 's " Homme , femmes : mode d'emploi " ( Men , women : instructions for use ) .
He plays a power-hungry lawyer in the movie described as " a tender and cruel comedy " by Lelouche , who is making his <number> film .
" I have paid too dearly for mixing two careers , " Tapie said . "
In France , you cannot be a film artist and a national politician at the same time .
That is why I will no longer be deputy by the time the film opens . "
Justice Minister Jacques Toubon began last month the formal process of ejecting Tapie from the French parliament as well as stripping him of his seat in the European parliament .
The French procedure was expected to be completed before October <number> , when the National Assembly is to reconvene after a summer break , but the European procedure was expected to take longer .
Tapie 's lawyer has said he intends to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in an effort to prevent or delay the loss of his European seat .
But such an appeal , even if the court were to accept the case , which it is not obliged to do , would not suspend enforcement of the French judgement against him .
Tapie faces a probable spell in prison after he loses his parliamentary immunity , since two appeal courts have confirmed jail sentences of eight and six months against him for tax fraud and rigging a soccer match .
He is appealing in both cases to the Supreme Court .

FOCUS - Eurobourses end mixed but London recovers .
Leonard Santorelli
LONDON <number>
European bourses closed mixed on Tuesday with London clawing back most of the day 's losses despite an unsteady start on wall Street , hit by inflation worries .
The dollar weakened during the day with many dealers sidelined because of uncertainty over Tokyo 's monetary direction ahead of the important Japanese Tankan economic survey out on Wednesday .
But it recovered at the close of trade .
Stocks in London started the week badly after a three-day weekend , slipping <number> percent , but bargain-hunters later moved in and the FTSE index recovered most of the lost ground to end only just in negative ground .
Tuesday 's patchy showing in London followed a string of records last week , culminating in Friday 's trading high of <number> , fuelled by a wave of European interest rate cuts .
The London bourse drew little help from the unsettled morning on Wall Street , which slipped in and out of positive ground after a stronger-than-expected August consumer confidence report refuelled inflation fears , pulling U.S. Treasuries back from their early peaks .
Shortly after the report appeared showing the confidence index rising to <number> in August from a revised <number> in July , Wall Street relinquished virtually all its morning gains .
" Treasuries remain very sensitive to any indication of a strong economy and we 're still in that summer doldrum period of light trading , " said Alan Ackerman , market strategist at Fahnestock & Co . "
Consequently , stocks and bonds are both subject to rapid swings . "
Frankfurt was the one bright spot in Europe .
Floor trading ended up <number> percent and the computerised IBIS index climbed nearly <number> percent , given a push by the performance of chemical shares . "
The market is trading <number> percent on fundamentals at the moment as interest rate fantasy disappears -- it 's all company news , " said one trader .
French shares ended slightly down amid growing unease about a difficult autumn for the government which also weighed on the franc , dealers said .
Bond prices were weaker and the franc was quoted at <number> per mark for the first time since August <number> as worries about the government 's autumn budget and a weak U.S. currency lifted the mark and squeezed French investments .
The dollar , which dropped sharply on Monday because of jitters over the Japanese Tankan survey , weakened further in quiet trading but regained losses to end the day close to Monday 's levels .
" Besides the Tankan , there 's nothing really until the U.S. jobs numbers next week , " said a UK bank corporate dealer . "
There is still the summer malaise hanging over the market . "
Foreign exchange markets regard the Tankan report as an important indication of the country 's future monetary policy direction .
If it points to weakness in the economy , the report will help the dollar regain some lost ground as speculation of a near-term rise in Japanese interest rates will evaporate .
The Japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of <number> percent .
The dollar was also pressured by the mark 's strength against European currencies amid renewed concerns over Europe 's economic and monetary union ( EMU ) timetable .

More hostages freed from hijacked Sudanese plane .
STANSTED , England <number>
Armed hijackers believed to be Iraqis released between <number> and <number> people on Tuesday from a Sudan Airways plane carrying <number> passengers and crew that landed in London after being diverted on a flight from Khartoum to Amman , authorities said .
A spokesman for Stansted airport said that the unidentified hijackers were demanding to see a British-based member of the Iraqi Community Association , called Mr Sadiki , and that police were trying to trace him .

FEATURE - " Eco terrorists " target UK builders .
Edna Fernandes
LONDON <number>
Ecological warfare has broken out across the British construction industry , striking some of the biggest corporates as activists give up peaceful protests and seek to hit builders where it hurts -- their profit margins .
Described by one British company as " eco-terrorism " , it is seen as the new business risk of the <number> .
Famous names like Tarmac Plc , Costain Group Plc and ARC , a unit of conglomerate Hanson Plc , have all been targeted .
Activist groups are no longer seen by British firms as a harmless , badly organised ragbag of students and hippies .
" You only have to see them in action at protests , " said David Harding , spokesman at ARC , Hanson 's aggregates company . "
They walk around with mobile phones and camera equipment , they communicate and gather support for demos via the Internet -- we 're talking about a highly sophisticated organisation . "
One road protestor under the codename Steady Eddie told construction journal " Building " earlier this year , " If it comes down to full-scale economic warfare , we will aim to drive them out of business . "
As well as financial threats , companies also emphasise the " terror " tactics used .
Costain 's contract to build the controversial Newbury bypass , which runs through a conservation area , has led to violent protests delaying building , bomb threats , staff intimidation and picketing of chief executive Alan Lovell 's home .
A Costain spokesman told Reuters : " We 've had all sorts of protests at the head office and the chief executive 's house .
But it 's when it gets to the ( employee ) families -- that it goes across the line . "
Tactics used by some underground groups including the cryptic Berkshire Wood Elves , which distribute leaflets with instructions on home-made explosives , are now the subject of a police investigation .
Other larger activist groups include Earth First , The Land is Ours , Alarm UK and Road Alert .
The groups have targeted specific projects like the Newbury bypass and the <number> motorway through Twyford Down in the southern county of Hampshire .
But they are also campaigning on broader issue such as stopping the government road building programme and out-of-town superstores which they say create more traffic , pollution and damage local communities .
The government has slashed its road-building spending .
Although protests may have contributed to the decision it has been seen primarily as economic rather than ecological .
Graham Watts , chief executive of the Construction Industry Council , said : " I do n't think many firms involved in tendering for sensitive projects realise the impact environmental activity has on the cost of running a project .
" But they are more alert than they were <number> years ago .
There 's no doubt it 's a big issue now . "
He says the damage comes in two forms : " Tangible -- in the form of extra costs , additional security , threats to staff and the more intangible damage caused by negative publicity . "
Watts said the cost of protesting can be heavy once the company is locked into a contract .
" I do often hear on the industry circuit of tales where the company tenders at low margins and the demonstrations which follow means they are running the project at a loss . "
ARC says it 's not just contractors in the front line but also suppliers like itself .
Its own quarries came under attack after it emerged that it may be a supplier for the Newbury bypass .
" It was called the " First Battle of the Newbury bypass ' , " said ARC 's Harding .
" We had <number> Earth First protestors invade and occupy our site .
Hundreds of thousands of pounds ( dollars ) of damage was done in one day .
Plus there was the knock-on cost of lost production and extra security in future . "
Simon Brown , analyst at investement bank UBS , said this new phenomenon has led to a change in the way the industry evaluates project risk .
" When talking to Tarmac about the <number> link ( through Twyford Down ) they made it fairly clear that their risk assessment methods have been changed and now involve a very clear environmental risk analysis . "
Harding says others have done the same . "
As a result of eco-terrorism we are looking at controversial jobs more closely to see if the profit margins are wide enough to cover things like extra security . "
For an industry already suffering from razor-thin margins , overcapacity and stagnant demand , eco-terrorism is the latest bizarre twist in the construction sector 's tale of woe .

Seve Ballesteros and Colin Montgomerie are divided on whether Jose Maria Olazabal should be allowed to return to the European PGA Tour using a motorised cart to transport him around the course .
The Spaniard has not played for nearly a year because of rheumatoid arthritis in both his feet , and organisers of a pairs event to be staged in Bordeaux , France from October <number> to <number> have been asked to provide him with a buggy .
" If the ( Tour 's tournament ) committee decides to change the rule I would not be against it , " said Ballesteros , Olazabal 's compatriot and Ryder Cup captain .
But commitee member Montgomerie said it could set an unhelpful precedent . "
I know Olly 's situation is very unfortunate , but I do n't think we can start giving dispensations , " he said . "
You 've got to have a rule for everybody and I do n't think it 's feasible . "
The use of carts is generally prohibited in the professional game , and if Olazabal is allowed to use one in Bordeaux , he might then request one for the qualifying tournaments for next year 's Ryder Cup .

TENNIS - CHANG , WASHINGTON ADVANCE , TWO WOMEN 'S SEEDS FALL .
Larry Fine
NEW YORK <number>
Michael Chang is playing in his <number> U.S. Open and enjoying his highest seeding ever , but the <number> American had to overcome a case of the jitters Monday before winning his first-round match on opening day .
Chang , seeded second behind defending champion Pete Sampras , took two hours <number> minutes to defeat <number> Jaime Oncins of Brazil <number> <number> <number> <number> , <number> in the tiebreaker .
" I was pretty tight the whole match , " conceded Chang , one of the hottest players on tour this summer with a <number> record on hardcourts that included two titles and a runner-up finish .
" Everyone has moments when they get tight .
Hopefully , this will have been my nerves for the whole tournament . "
Joining Chang into the second round was Wimbledon runner-up MaliVai Washington , the <number> seed , who also needed four sets to get past talented Moroccan Karim Alami <number> <number> <number> ( <number> ) <number> .
Washington 's win was not comfortable , either .
The <number> American hurried off the Stadium Court for treatment of an upset stomach after his two and a half hour struggle against Alami .
" Towards the end of my match my stomach felt like week-old sushi , " said Washington . "
Maybe it was a combination of the heat and something I ate . "
Chang and Washington were the only men 's seeds in action on a day that saw two seeded women 's players fall .
Australian Open runner-up Anke Huber of Germany , the sixth seed , was undone by an unlucky draw that put her against <number> ranked South African Amanda Coetzer in her opening match .
Coetzer claimed revenge for the semifinal defeat she suffered to Huber in Melbourne by taking a <number> <number> <number> victory .
Last year 's Wimbledon junior champion , Aleksandra Olsza of Poland , removed another seed from the draw by eliminating number <number> Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria <number> <number> .
Other men 's winners included a pair of former Grand Slam tournament champions whose victories set up a showdown in the second round .
Germany 's Michael Stich , the <number> Wimbledon champion , and two-time French Open winner Sergi Bruguera of Spain will face each other next after beating German Tommy Haas <number> <number> <number> <number> , and Belgian Kris Goossens <number> <number> <number> ( <number> ) , respectively .
Alex O'Brien , who scored his first professional title eight days ago in New Haven , advanced to the second round with a <number> <number> <number> <number> win over Ecuador 's Nicolas Lapentti .
Wimbledon bad boy Jeff Tarango caught a break Monday when he advanced after the retirement of German Alex Radulescu due to heat exhaustion .
Tarango was leading <number> ( <number> ) <number> <number> <number> .
Chang blamed breezy conditions for some of the erratic play in his match with Oncins , who had beaten him in the round of <number> at the <number> Barcelona Olympics .
Chang committed an untidy <number> unforced errors , though he made seven fewer than the Brazilian , who also walloped a woeful <number> double faults .
The most deflating double fault came when Oncins was serving to force a fifth set , leading <number> in the tiebreaker .
The set point came after confusion at the net on the point previous , which was awarded to Oncins after the two exchanged shots at close quarters at the net .
First Chang approached the umpire , then Oncins , then Chang again before play finally resumed .
" Those little seconds were like an hour to me , " said Oncins , who promptly fired two serves barely contained by the baseline as he frittered away his best chance .
Chang ran off the next three points to close out the match but for Oncins , the contest was a personal victory .
The <number> Brazilian had risen into the top <number> in <number> .
The next year a close friend was struck by a stray bullet while riding home in a car from a soccer game in Sao Paulo .
He died slumped against Oncins , who subsequently lost interest in tennis .
" Two months ago I started talking about quitting , " said Oncins , who decided to give it one last try and made it through the Open qualifying tournament last weekend .
" I believe in my game again , " he said .
At the end of the day , a spate of withdrawals from the tournament were announced .
Eighth seed Jim Courier withdrew because of a bruised right knee , and <number> Open champion Mats Wilander bowed out due to a groin pull , organisers said .
Women 's ninth seed Mary Joe Fernandez pulled out because of tendinitis in her right wrist .

SOCCER - MARSEILLE HOLD AUXERRE TO GOALLESS DRAW .
PARIS <number>
Former European champions Marseille held French champions Auxerre to a goalless draw in a lacklustre league match on Tuesday .
The bill looked promising but both sides , struggling to find their form early in the season , were disappointing .
Auxerre , who start their European Cup campaign next week against Ajax Amsterdam , dominated the match but were unable to score .
Unbeaten in four matches , they still trail leaders Lens by one point .
Lens , who have won all their three league matches so far , host Montpellier on Wednesday night .
Despite another dismal performance , especially in defence , Marseille restored some pride by keeping the reigning champions at bay after losing <number> at home to Metz last Saturday .
After two seasons in the second division and after taking on half a dozen new recruits this season , some of whom do not speak a word of French , Marseille are not playing with any fluidity .
But German international goalkeeper Andreas Koepke again proved a sound investment when under pressure from the Auxerre strikers , saving his team with a number of fine parries .
Marseille now lie seventh in the league on five points .

Cyprien , also fined <number> Swiss francs ( $ <number> ) , traded punches with St Gallen 's Brazilian player Claudio Moura after a match on Saturday .
When officials and coaching staff tried to intervene , Cyprien launched a flying kick at Moura , but only succeeded in kneeing St Gallen coach Roger Hegi in the stomach .
Moura , who appeared to have elbowed Cyprien in the final minutes of the <number> win by Neuchatel , was suspended for seven matches and fined <number> francs ( $ <number> ) by the Swiss league disciplinary committee .
Club president Gilbert Facchinetti said he was astonished the committee had arrived at its decision so quickly and vowed the club would appeal .
Neuchatel coach Gilbert Gress described the incident as " shocking " , but said Moura was also to blame .
" Moura physically and verbally provoked Cyprien during the match .
The referee could not have seen it or he would have punished him , " Gress said .
" During the scuffle , Moura threw the first punch .
Tomorrow , if someone punches me , I would not know how to react . "
Cyprien , who won his one French cap against Italy in February <number> , cannot play in Switzerland or elsewhere until May next year .

COFINEC SLIPS ON BUDAPEST BOURSE BUT FUTURE STRONG .
Emese Bartha
BUDAPEST <number>
Expectations that Cofinec S.A. , the Hungarian bourse 's first foreign listing , will report a disappointing first half have depressed the stock below its issue price , but analysts expect a rebound in the long term .
" The first half of the year is unlikely to be as strong as expected so the company will probably be unable to reach its annual plan in <number> , " said Gabor Sitanyi , a London-based analyst for ING Barings .
The French-registered packaging materials company , which floated its shares in Hungary in July , for most of the past two weeks hovered below the <number> forints / Global Depositary Receipts price of its initial offering , which was oversubscribed .
The company , which asked for a two-week delay from the usual August <number> deadline for reporting first-half results , closed on Tuesday at <number> forints , down <number> .
" Cofinec 's first-half figures will be ...
between one-third of two-fifths of its annual plan , " said Tamas Erdei , a Budapest-based analyst for ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett .
Analysts blame , at least partly , Hungary 's macroeconomic environment for the weaker figures for Cofinec which , operating in Hungary , Poland and the Czech Republic , now generates about <number> to <number> percent of its annual sales from Hungary .
Hungary 's Gross Domestic Product fell one percentage point in the first quarter while real wages plunged <number> percentage points in the first half of <number> .
Both will have their impact on Cofinec 's figures , the analysts said .
Despite the current difficulties , however , analysts were convinced that Cofinec 's outlook was strong .
" The eastern European market offers good chances , " said Erdei . "
Just like many other companies on the bourse , Cofinec has big growth opportunities . "
" At the same time , it 's an advantage for Cofinec that it has a foreign management which perhaps understands the market better , " Erdei added .
" Cofinec is a very good story in the long-term as the per capita packaging consumption is still so low in east Europe that a very strong increase can be expected ( long-term ) , " Sitanyi said , saying that several recent moves by Cofinec boosted its position .
Among them , he noted that Cofinec had acquired the outstanding stake in its Czech folding company Krpaco a.s. , increasing its ownership to <number> percent , so in the second half the whole of Krpaco 's figures will be consolidated .
The company also repaid some $ <number> million of debt , well above the originally planned $ <number> million to $ <number> million .
In addition , its Polish operation began with some six weeks of delay due to cold winter weather and the test run was also longer than planned .

Sudanese rebels say missionaries should be freed .
Peter Smerdon
NAIROBI <number>
The main rebel group in south Sudan said on Tuesday it was trying to arrange the release of six Roman Catholic missionaries , including three Australian nuns , held for nearly two weeks .
George Garang , Nairobi spokesman for the Sudan People 's Liberation Army ( SPLA ) , said it was urgently trying to contact SPLA commander Nuour Marial at Mapourdit in the south to free the six .
" The movement is making arrangements for them to be set free .
This is a decision of the leadership , " Garang said .
" Commander Nuour Marial is a soldier so he must accept the leadership 's decision .
But communications at this time of year are very difficult because of rains and a lack of power , " he added .
The Catholic Information Office in Nairobi said on Monday that four of the six had been charged by the SPLA with spying , spreading Islam and hindering recruitment into the rebel group .
" These charges are the interpretation of the church , " Garang said on Tuesday . "
We have no idea why they are being held .
We are still trying to establish contact with the local commander . "
Asked whether this meant the commander was out of control , Garang said the rebel movement was working on the problem .
He said he believed all six were being held in the mission compound at Mapourdit and were reported to be in good health .
The Catholic Information office in Nairobi said on Monday that Australian Sisters Moira Lynch , <number> , and Mary Batchelor , <number> , American Father Michael Barton , <number> , and Sudanese Father Raphael Riel , <number> , were held in a prison in south Sudan by the SPLA .
It said Australian Sister Maureen Carey , <number> , and Italian Brother Raniero Iacomella , <number> , were held inside the compound .
The church in Australia said on Monday Lynch , Batchelor , Barton and Riel were held in a prison until the weekend , when they were moved to join the other captives at the compound .
The Catholic Information Office said the SPLA in the Kenyan capital had attributed the detentions of the six to a local commander and had promised they would be freed by August <number> .
But the church learned in a recent meeting with the local commander that no instructions to release the prisoners were received and they would be held until investigations were completed .
It said last Friday they were visited by Monsignor Caesar Mazzolari , apostolic administrator of the diocese of Rumbek in southern Sudan , and an SPLA administrator and appeared in good condition .
" On August <number> the mission was surrounded ( by the SPLA ) and sealed off .
The evening of the same day the missionaries were put in prison or isolation .
Later the mission was looted , " it added .
An Australian foreign ministry official said the charges against them were " fairly bizarre " and a matter for concern .
He said Australian diplomats in Nairobi were working with the Roman Catholic church in southern Sudan and with U.S. and Italian diplomats in the region to help free the missionaries .
The SPLA has fought Khartoum 's government forces in the south since <number> for greater autonomy or independence of the mainly Christian and animist region from the Moslem , Arabised north .

OSCE postpones Bosnian municipal elections .
SARAJEVO <number>
The U.S. diplomat in charge of elections in Bosnia announced on Tuesday that voting for municipal assemblies would be postponed because of irregularities by the Serbs in registering voters .
Ambassador Robert Frowick , representing the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , told reporters that municipal polls due on September <number> with other Bosnian elections would be put off .
" I have made a chairman 's decision that it is not feasible to hold municipal elections on September <number> , " said Frowick .
He said no exact date had been set but it was possible the local elections would take place in the spring of <number> .
According to OSCE officials , Serb authorities have pressed their refugees to register to vote in towns now under Serb control , but which used to have Moslem majorities .
Human rights workers say authorities in Serbia and Bosnian Serb territory have conducted a well-organised campaign to coerce refugees into registering only on Serb territory and failed to inform them of their rights under the Dayton peace agreement .
Diplomats say the effect of the electoral engineering would be to establish political control over districts they conquered and ethnically cleansed in war .
The response of the Bosnian Serbs to the OSCE 's announcement was not immediately clear .
But Bosnian Serb leaders have hinted they would boycott the poll if the municipal elections were postponed , or go ahead with their own .
The Bosnian Serb cabinet , in a letter to the OSCE , said on Monday that any delay of local elections would be " a direct and flagrant violation fo the Dayton agreement " .
The Serbs , who administer half of Bosnia in a Serb republic , said they had met all conditions for holding the September elections .
Diplomats fear that the crisis could cast doubt over the entire election process , which already appears set to confirm Bosnia 's ethnic partition rather than its reintegration as the Dayton peace agreement had planned .

New talks in Chechnya as Lebed waits for Yeltsin .
Dmitry Kuznets
NOVYE ATAGI , Russia <number>
Russian and rebel military commanders finally met in Chechnya on Tuesday for delayed talks aimed at finalising a ceasefire arranged last week by President Boris Yeltsin 's envoy Alexander Lebed .
The Russian army commander in the region , General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov , arrived at the rebel-held village of Novye Atagi , some <number> km ( <number> miles ) south of the Chechen capital Grozny for discussions with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov .
But Lebed himself , the Kremlin security chief , is still waiting back in Moscow to meet Yeltsin over his plans for a lasting political settlement in Chechnya .
Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Kremlin press service as saying Yeltsin , who left for a state holiday home near Moscow on Monday , would hold no working meetings on Tuesday .
Lebed interrupted talks with Chechnya 's separatists on a political deal on Sunday , saying he had to consult with Yeltsin .
After a meeting failed to materialise on Monday , Lebed 's spokesman said he might meet the president on Tuesday .
But Yeltsin 's spokesman rebuffed the suggestion , saying the president had left Moscow for a holiday near the capital .
The Russians postponed the talks after a Chechen band disarmed a column of interior ministry troops on Sunday .
The Chechens said a renegade group seized the weapons and said on Monday they had all been returned .
The Russian command insisted that not all the weapons were the same as those taken .
Tass said the weapons and the practical implementation of the ceasefire signed by Lebed and Maskhadov last Thursday would be on the agenda of today 's talks .
Neither spoke to reporters before the meeting , which started around <number> a.m. ( <number> GMT ) .
Also in Novye Atagi on Tuesday morning , was Tim Guldimann , the Swiss diplomat who heads the Chechnya mission of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) .
Guldimann , who helped broker an earlier truce in May , was not taking part in the Tikhomirov-Maskhadov talks .
Lebed 's peace mission this month has stopped some of the worst fighting of the <number> conflict .
However , tension on the ground indicates that it could falter if the momentum for a settlement is not maintained .
Three Russian servicemen were wounded in a total of six shooting incidents overnight , Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Russian military as saying on Tuesday morning .
RIA news agency quoted an army source accusing rebel fighters of failing to turn up for joint Russian-Chechen police patrols in some districts of the capital Grozny on Tuesday .
But the separatist command told Interfax news agency the patrols , part of the truce brokered by Lebed last week , would begin on Tuesday after delays for " technical reasons " .
Yeltsin 's spokesman said he might meet officials during his break , but indicated Lebed was low on the list by saying Yeltsin would need time to study the proposals before talking to him .
Russian news agencies also quoted the Kremlin spokesman as saying that Lebed 's representatives had not sought a meeting , hinting at an attempt by the president to put his popular and outspoken protege in his place with a lesson on protocol .
Yeltsin , <number> , has kept a low profile since he was reelected in July , prompting new speculation that the two heart attacks he suffered last year and a rumoured drinking problem could be taking their toll , weakening his grip on affairs of state .
Aides have dismissed such speculation , insisting that he simply needs a rest after his energetic election campaign .
Some analysts say the Kremlin leader , whose order sending troops and tanks into Chechnya in <number> started Russia 's ill-fated military campaign , could merely be reluctant to put his name to a peace process which might fall apart .
But Lebed , who has no real power without his boss and has hinted at dark forces in Moscow working against him , appears to think a deal will not stick without strong backing from Yeltsin .
His proposals have not been spelled out but are expected to involve a compromise between the separatists ' demand for independence and Moscow 's insistence that Chechnya remain part of the Russian Federation .

Nationalists want Iliescu ousted for Hungary pact .
BUCHAREST <number>
Junior Nationalist members of Romania 's ruling coalition called on Tuesday for the impeachment of President Ion Iliescu for backing a friendship treaty with neighbouring Hungary .
Iliescu 's Party of Social Democracy , the senior coalition partner , immediately dismissed the National Unity Party ( PUNR ) demand as crude electioneering .
" It is a desperate move by the PUNR , which is losing its only reason for existing ahead of the electoral campaign , " said PDSR executive president Adrian Nastase .
" This treaty is both necessary and good , " Nastase said , adding that the PUNR 's stance was threatening its position in the government .
The treaty agreed unexpectedly two weeks ago will end years of disputes over the status of Romania 's large ethnic Hungarian minority .
It will also boost both countries ' chances of admission to NATO and the European Union .
" If they ( the PUNR ) are so vexed , they could leave the government ...
We might also help them to do it , if they go on like this , " he said .
The PUNR holds four key ministries -- justice , transport , agriculture and communications .
PUNR leader Gheorghe Funar said in a statement Iliescu , in power since the fall of communism in <number> , should be impeached for treason for compromising on the issue of ethnic Hungarian minority rights in the treaty due to be signed next month .
Funar 's call came on the eve of the official launch of Iliescu 's campaign for a new term at November <number> polls .
His appeal to the opposition to back his attempt to oust Iliescu was unlikely to succeed , analysts said .
Iliescu has invited political leaders to a meeting on Thursday to discuss the final form of the pact which both Romanian and Hungarian nationalists oppose for different reasons .
Presidential officials were not available to comment on the call for Iliescu 's impeachment .

Estonia 's parliament failed for a second time to elect a president on Tuesday , dealing a blow to incumbent Lennart Meri and pushing the country towards stalemate in its choice of a new head of state .

Marc Dutroux , the chief accused in Belgium 's sensational child murder and sex abuse case , visited Slovakia a number of times and about <number> young Slovak women went to Belgium at his invitation , police said on Tuesday .

Dutch government wo n't pay ransom for kidnap victims .
SAN JOSE , Costa Rica <number>
The Netherlands government has ruled out paying ransom money for a Dutch couple kidnapped from their farm , while Costa Rican authorities said on Tuesday they had no leads in the case .
" We have not had contact with the kidnappers nor do we have any leads to take us to where they might be held , " Chief of Judicial Police Manuel Alvarado told Reuters .
Hurte Sierd Zylstra and his wife , Jetsi Hendrika Coers , both <number> , were abducted from the teak plantation they managed late Saturday or early Sunday by at least two men demanding $ <number> million ransom , authorities said .
Costa Rican officials on Monday had given different names for the couple .
Anton Schutte , an official with the embassy for Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg , said the Dutch government had ruled out paying any money in ransom . "
We 're looking at a criminal act that has no political aspect as far as what we can tell , " Schutte added .
A note with the ransom demand was left in the couple 's car , which was used in the kidnapping , Schutte told a news conference on Monday .
He said the note , believed to have been hand-written in Spanish and signed by the victims , was addressed to Ebe Huizinga , another Dutch citizen who owns the tree plantation . "
Depending on you , we will either live or die , " it said .
Alvarado said the car was abandoned about <number> miles ( <number> km ) north of the couple 's house but said that did not indicate the kidnappers intended to take their victims into neighbouring Nicaragua .
The farm is in the border region where a German tourist and a Swiss tour guide were kidnapped last New Year 's Eve by a heavily armed band led by a former Nicaraguan guerrilla .
The two were held for <number> days until relatives paid a ransom .

Brazil likely to turn Banespa federal bank - paper .
SAO PAULO <number>
Brazil is likely to turn Sao Paulo state bank Banespa into a federal bank in a prior step to privatization , according to unnamed government sources , O Globo daily said .
The newspaper said the Central Bank special administration of Banespa ends in December <number> and after that the bank has to be liquidated or turned into a federal bank since there are no conditions to return Banespa to Sao Paulo state government .
A Central Bank spokesman said he could not confirm or deny the report .
Banespa has been under central bank special temporary administration since December <number> .
The central bank management could be lifted if Sao Paulo state decided to take part in the recent federal government 's plan to restructure state banks .
Under the plan , the federal government would provide <number> percent of the financing needed to restructure debt of state banks being privatized , liquidated or turned into development banks .
It also offers to refinance up to <number> percent of the debt held by state banks whose governments decide to keep control of their banks .
Although the plan was designed under terms proposed by Sao Paulo state governor Mario Covas , he has showed no interest in taking part in the plan because Sao Paulo 's debt with Banespa has increased sharply , O Globo said .
Sao Paulo state 's debt is now estimated at <number> billion reais .
O Globo also said another delicate case to be solved involves private bank Bamerindus .
The newspaper said Bamerindus has sent to the Central Bank a proposal for restructuring combined with a request for a <number> credit line , paying four percent a year plus the Basic Interest Rate of the Central Bank ( TBC ) .
O Globo also said the loan would give Bamerindus time to sell assets .

BAGHDAD <number>
A new U.N. relief coordinator has arrived in Baghdad to take up the task of organising humanitarian goods distribution and to face Iraq 's continuing opposition over the number of international monitors to be involved .
U.N. and diplomatic sources said on Tuesday that Secretary- General Boutros Boutros-Ghali had appointed Italian Gualtiero Fulcheri and sent him to Iraq last week to replace Moroccan Mohamed Zejjari .
One diplomat said Iraq and U.N. were still in disagreement on how many international observers would be required to ascertain the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies that will be procured under Baghdad 's oil deal with U.N .
" The United Nations would like to employ hundreds of foreign monitors .
Baghdad says it can only accept a few dozens , " said the diplomat .
Baghdad holds that the Iraq-U.N. memorandum of understanding on partial oil sales signed last June does not specify how many foreign observers should be stationed in Iraq .
" Observation of food supplies and their distribution are still a major issue and seems the two sides have not yet filled the gap separating them , " said another diplomat .
Iraq 's partial oil sales pact with U.N. , allowing crude exports worth $ <number> billion every six months , gives U.N. the right to supervise the purchase and distribution of food supplies in the country .
The deal is a humanitarian exception to the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in <number> which include a ban on its oil exports .

Anti-abortion speaker praises Democrat tolerance .
Alan Elsner
CHICAGO <number>
An anti-abortion politician addressed the Democratic convention on Tuesday , but praised the overwhelmingly pro-abortion rights party for its tolerance of his minority views .
Rep .
Tony Hall of Ohio said he and other Democrats who opposed abortion had always felt left out in their own party .
" But this year is different .
For the first time , the Democratic Party has included in our platform a conscience clause , " he said .
The clause recognizes and welcomes Democrats with divergent views on abortion and states they have a full part to play at all levels of the party .
" The Democratic Party is indeed the party of true inclusiveness , " Hall said .
At its convention four years ago , organizers prevented then Pennsylvania Gov .
Robert Casey , a vehement opponent of abortion , from speaking .
Republicans have used their decision as an example of Democrat intolerance ever since .
Casey told a news conference in Chicago on Tuesday he had asked to speak again this year but was turned down .
Democratic leaders said there was not room on the program for every retired governor to speak .
" I believe the Democratic party ought to be pro-woman , pro-child and pro-life , " Casey said .
" I asked for the opportunity to deliver this message from the podium of the Democrat National Convention .
For the second time in four years , my request fell on deaf ears , " he said .
The Republican Party , whose platform calls for making all abortions illegal , faced a similar dilemma this year when Massachusetts Gov .
William Weld asked to deliver a speech defending abortion rights and was turned down .
Bob Dole , the Republican presidential nominee , tried and failed to insert a tolerance clause in his party 's platform recognizing the validity of those within the party who supported abortion rights .
Democrats also heard Tuesday two passionate speeches defending abortion rights .
Kate Michelman , president of the National Abortion Rights Action League , described how she had an abortion at a time when the procedure was illegal after her husband abandoned her with three young children .
" I 'm here to speak up for choice and to speak for truth .
The message from the Republican Party is one of disdain .
Their answer to choice is control and punishment .
Our answer is trust , compassion and respect , " she said .

Cynthia McKinney said : " You make your moral decisions .

CALCUTTA <number>
Mother Teresa spent her <number> birthday in a Calcutta hospital bed on Tuesday as tributes to the legendary missionary poured in from around the world .
Doctors said that later in the day they would try to wean the Nobel Peace Prize laureate from the respirator that has aided her breathing for the past six days .
" Her condition seems to be better , but the danger remains as long as she is on respirator , " an official at Woodlands Nursing Home said . "
She is conscious but her breathing is irregular . "
The revered Roman Catholic nun was admitted to the Calcutta hospital a week ago with high fever and severe vomiting .
She later suffered heart failure and was diagnosed with malaria .
Her fever has since abated and the heart failure has been brought under control , but her heart continues to beat irregularly , doctors said .
" Unless she breathes on her own , I would advise you to keep your fingers crossed , " said a doctor who was familiar with her case but not part of the six-member team treating Mother Teresa .
The nun 's birthday prompted greetings , bouquets and prayers from around the world .
Pope John Paul II and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy sent her get-well messages , the Press Trust of India said .
" Ask for a miracle .
Happy Birthday to our Dearest Mother , " read a placard at the Shishu Bhavan children 's home in central Calcutta run by Mother Teresa 's Missionaries of Charity .
On Monday , both houses of India 's parliament wished the nation 's adopted sister a happy birthday and speedy recovery from her illness .
Prayers continued in Calcutta , one of the world 's poorest cities , where Mother Teresa 's Missionaries of Charity runs several homes for the poor and destitute .
Street children , some of them born to prostitutes , held prayers on the street . "
All of us know about her .
She is like a goddess , " said Raju , <number> , who has a mother but no father .
The Statesman newspaper quoted <number> Mangala Das , paralysed from her waist down and a resident of the Prem Dan ( Gift of Love ) home for the destitute , as saying she and her friends had been praying incessantly for Mother Teresa 's recovery .
Tarak Das , <number> , was picked up from a Calcutta footpath a week ago by passers-by who took pity on him and brought him to Nirmal Hriday ( Immaculate Home ) .
" I do not know who she is .
I have never seen her , but I can only bless her for what she has done for people like me , " Das told The Statesman .
Mother Teresa 's condition improved on Sunday as her fever abated , and on Monday she was able to scribble notes to doctors and nuns .
Thousands in Calcutta , where she founded her Missionaries of Charity religious order in <number> , prayed for her recovery .
Ministers of the communist government of West Bengal state and people of different religions joined Catholics to pray for Mother Teresa 's recovery at Mother House .
" We joined the prayer to express our solidarity with her work for the cause of the poor and downtrodden , " said Nanda Gopal Bhattacharya , a communist minister in West Bengal .

Islamists can meet in London , minister .
ISLAMABAD <number>
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said on Tuesday that his government would only take action against a planned conference of Islamist groups in London if British law was broken .
" People who wish to hold conferences of course do n't need to seek permission from the government in Britain , " Rifkind , in Pakistan for a visit , told Reuters . "
As long as they obey our laws then that is not something the government would normally interfere with . "
The Islamist conference , due to be held in London on September <number> , has caused concern in countries such as Algeria and Egypt , which are fighting armed Islamic militants .
British Jewish groups have also protested because they say members of Algeria 's Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) and the Palestinian Islamic group Hamas are on the guest list .
Rifkind said it was for the home secretary ( interior minister ) to act by denying visas to participants if he felt there was reason to believe that they might break the law .
" Our policy has to be fundamentally based on respect for the rule of law and insistence that it be observed , " he said .
Rifkind was in Pakistan at the start of an Asian tour that will also take him to India , Sri Lanka , Japan and Mongolia .

Afghan leader tells U.S. Congressman of peace plan .

KABUL <number>
Afghan government military chief Ahmad Shah Masood briefed visiting U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher on Tuesday on a peace plan for his wartorn country .
A spokesman for Masood said he had told the California Republican at a meeting in northern Kabul that President Burhanuddin Rabbani 's government favoured talks with all Afghan factions to set up an interim government .
The factions should agree to appoint a transitional leader , draft a new constitution , collect heavy weapons , create a national army and hold free elections in which the transitional leader would be barred from standing , he added .
Rohrabacher flew into Bagram military airbase north of Kabul in a Red Cross plane on Tuesday after meeting northern opposition militia leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum .
Masood 's spokesman Amrollah ( one name ) said Rohrabacher had recently visited Italy , Saudi Arabia and Pakistan as part of a mission to promote peace in Afghanistan .
" We are certainly serious more than before to find a solution to the Afghan problem and support every U.N. plan , " Amrollah quoted Rohrabacher as saying .
However , a spokesman for Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , a long-time rival of Masood , expressed concern at signs of renewed U.S. interest in Afghanistan .
" America wants to block the establishment of a strong Islamic government in Afghanistan and the U.S. intends to neutralise the Afghan peace process initiated by the Afghans themselves , " said the spokesman , Hamid Ibrahimi .
" A great game has been started in Afghanistan as America feels that Tehran and Moscow have got stronger in the Afghan picture -- something Washington wants to change , " he said .
Rohrabacher was expected to visit neutral faction leaders in the eastern city of Jalalabad and meet leaders of the rebel Islamic Taleban militia in the southern city of Kandahar .
Afghan guerrilla factions have been locked in a bloody power struggle since the fall of the communist government in April <number> .
Hekmatyar , once Rabbani 's main rival , made a peace pact with him and rejoined the government as prime minister in June .

Painted parrot scam lands Australian in jail .
PERTH , Australia <number>
A conman who painted common Australian parrots with dye to make them look like rare birds worth thousands of dollars was jailed for fraud on Tuesday .
Denham Peiris painted six green parrots , worth about A$ <number> ( US$ <number> ) a pair , with a cinnamon hair dye and traded them as Indian Ringneck Parrots , valued at A$ <number> a pair .
Peiris , <number> , of Perth , was sentenced in the Western Australian District Court to two years in jail for fraud after trading three pairs of impostor birds for <number> parrots worth a total of A$ <number> .
" Everyone was fooled , " said pet shop owner Shane Drew , who unknowingly traded the disguised birds .
" I 'd already had three local breeders have a look at them and sent photos and videos of the birds to the eastern states for authentication -- they said they 're nice birds , " Drew told reporters outside court .
" After I was told they were dyed , I checked them over again .
It was a perfect paint job except for one feather under a wing of one bird that was only half dyed , " Drew said .

Seoul embassies warned of terrorist attacks .
SEOUL <number>
South Korea has told its overseas missions to step up security since its embassy in the former Yugoslavia received a threat over Seoul 's crackdown on radical students , the foreign ministry said on Tuesday .
A letter to the Belgrade embassy on Monday under the name of the Macedonian Communist Party demanded South Korea release detained student leaders , a ministry spokesman said .
" The letter said the party would assault the embassy , other South Korean-related facilities and Korean nationals unless our authorities released arrested students , " he said .
Nearly <number> members of an outlawed student group were arrested after violent protests demanding reunification with communist North Korea were crushed by riot police at a Seoul university this month .
Authorities branded the violence , in which a police officer was killed , as an act of terror .
" The ministry has ordered the embassy to take urgent security measures against possible terrorist attacks , " the official said , asking not to be named .
It had called for similar precautions at other overseas missions , including those in Canada and Bangladesh where leftist groups have staged protests over the crackdown .

Nuclear pact will be a step to disarmament-China .
BEIJING <number>
China on Tuesday reaffirmed its support for a global nuclear test ban treaty blocked by India last week , saying the pact would be an important step in achieving total nuclear disarmament .
" Although the final draft of the treaty probably did n't totally satisfy any country , it was in general balanced , " the official People 's Daily newspaper said in a commentary .
India blocked the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva , saying the pact did not contain a clause committing the five declared nuclear powers to a timetable for nuclear disarmament .
New Delhi 's stance , which was seen as effectively thwarting <number> years of negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament , drew widespread but generally muted foreign criticism .
India has also pledged to oppose any forwarding of the draft treaty to the United Nations General Assembly .
China said many countries had compromised to complete the treaty and that the issue of a disarmament schedule could be discussed in future negotiations .
" The completion of the test ban treaty would be an important and practical step in the gradual process of achieving total nuclear disarmament , " it said .
China has pledged support for the pact since reaching a deal with the United States that made international inspections of nuclear sites more difficult than in earlier drafts of the accord .
The newspaper said China advocated the complete ban and destruction of nuclear weapons but that there was little hope other nuclear powers would soon adopt the same stance .
" Some nuclear powers stubbornly uphold policies of nuclear deterrence based on first use of nuclear weapons , " it said .
China held on July <number> what it said would be its last nuclear test before a self-imposed moratorium that took effect the following day .
China was the last declared nuclear power to announce a halt to testing .

Japan declares food poisoning threat receding .
TOKYO <number>
The government said on Tuesday that the threat from a mysterious killer germ , while still requiring vigilance , appears to be receding in the western Japan city of Sakai , where the epidemic hit the hardest .
The food poisoning epidemic caused by the <number> colon bacillus in Sakai appears to be " settling down " , Health Minister Naoto Kan was quoted by a government spokesman as telling the cabinet .
The <number> colon bacillus has been found responsible for a widespread food poisoning epidemic that has killed <number> people and made over <number> ill this year .
Sakai , near the regional commercial centre of Osaka , has been hit hardest by the deadly bacteria , with nearly <number> , mostly schoolchildren , affected by the disease .
Two children in Sakai have died from complications associated with the bacteria .
Kan told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that no new victims have been reported since August <number> , indicating that the peak has passed , at least for Sakai .
Sakai officials agreed with the assessment , but said it was too early to feel relieved .
" There are still patients hospitalised and problems which must be dealt with , " a city spokesman said , citing the issue of whether to allow children infected with the bacteria but not showing symptoms to attend school from September .
Health authorities believe school lunches were the source of the food poisoning in Sakai , but researchers have been unable to pinpoint the exact source of the infection .
The outbreak has prompted authorities to tighten sanitary standards at slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants and sparked calls for an overhaul of the nation 's school lunch programme .
The ministers agreed at Tuesday 's cabinet meeting to step up inspection measures for school lunches in September and October , when schools around the country resume .
Japan 's Agriculture Ministry also announced that it will compile hygiene guidelines based on U.S. government methods of checking the safety of farm produce to prevent another outbreak of the epidemic .
As of Monday , <number> children were still hospitalised in Sakai city , of whom six were in serious condition .

TOKYO <number>
Japanese shipments of aluminium mill products in July surged <number> percent over the same month last year to <number> tonnes , while production rose <number> percent to <number> tonnes , according to preliminary data released on Tuesday by the Japan Aluminium Federation .
The surge reflected strong demand from the beverage can and housing construction sectors , federation officials said .

A federation official added that the half-year through September <number> also appeared likely to set a new record for can production , despite cooler temperatures in August .
July inventories stood at <number> tonnes , down <number> percent from the prior month .
July foil output was off <number> percent year-on-year at <number> tonnes , while foil shipments fell <number> percent to <number> tonnes .

China thanks Gabon for support on human rights .
BEIJING <number>
China has publicly thanked Gabon for its strong support at the United Nations Human Rights Commission , where Beijing has come under attack from Western nations for its human rights record .
China 's President Jiang Zemin offered his gratitude in a meeting on Monday with visiting Gabon President Omar Bongo , the official Xinhua news agency said .
Jiang also acknowledged the Central African nation 's support for China 's stance on Taiwan , which Beijing views as a renegade province , while Bongo was quoted as thanking China for economic and technological aid , the agency said late on Monday .
In April , China quashed a draft resolution by the U.N. Human Rights Commission expressing concern over continuing reports of Beijing 's violations of fundamental freedoms .
After the defeat of the resolution , drafted by the European Union and the United States , China 's Foreign Ministry thanked <number> countries for backing its motion for " no action " on the document .
It was the sixth year in a row that China avoided censure at the U.N. 's main human rights forum .
China has been accused of a wide range of human rights abuses , often in violation of its own legal code , in an effort to silence dissent .
A Xinhua commentary earlier this year said a plot by the West to force its human rights standards and values on other countries was doomed to failure .

Palestinians to strike over Jerusalem demolition .
JERUSALEM <number>
Palestinian leaders in Jerusalem called on Tuesday for a two-hour strike to protest what they called Israel 's war on Arab East Jerusalem after police demolished a building there .
Israeli police demolished a <number> metre ( yard ) by <number> metre structure in Jerusalem 's Old City they said had been built with funding from the Palestinian self-rule Authority for use as a social club .
Police used a huge crane to lift a bulldozer over the Old City 's walls to reach the building amidst narrow alleys , witnesses said .
Bystanders at the scene said work had begun on the building in <number> and it had yet to be completed when the Israeli police bulldozed it .
The Palestinian Authority was set up under the <number> PLO-Israel interim peace deal .
" There has been a call for a general strike between one ( <number> GMT ) and three o'clock , " Palestinian lawmaker Ahmed Hashem Zighayer told Reuters .
" This is a war that has been declared on us and we want our people to come and see the site where they declared the war . "
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's government , which took office in June , has said it will not allow the Authority , set up under a <number> interim peace deal to control parts of the Gaza Strip and West Bank , to operate in Jerusalem .
Israel 's previous government held the same position but in general turned a blind eye to Palestinian Authority activity in the city .
Tuesday 's demolition came a day after PLO officials said they had bowed to Netanyahu 's demand they close offices in Jerusalem .
They said two of the three offices Israel wanted closed had been shut .
Netanyahu has made closure of the three offices a condition for resuming peace negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) .
Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the <number> Middle East war and annexed it .
It says it will never cede any part of the city .
Palestinians want East Jerusalem as capital of a future state .
The city is up for negotiation at final peace talks which have yet to resume under Netanyahu .

SEC adopts rules to improve investor access to best stock prices .
WASHINGTON <number>
The Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday approved rules designed to give stock market investors a better chance at getting the best price available for their orders .
The so-called order handling rules , which were proposed last September , were approved in a <number> vote .
The new rules will require specialists at stock exchanges and market makers on Nasdaq to allow customers to view price quotes from other electronic trading systems that may not be readily available to them .
The rules will also require that customer limit orders be displayed with prices better than those available in quotes publicly available at the time .
Specialists and market makers are companies or individuals recognised as qualified to maintain an orderly market in a stock .
In a limit order , investors specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell , as opposed to a market order executed at prevailing prices .
" These rules are intended to empower all investors , by allowing their orders to compete on a level playing field , and by providing the disclosure they need to make informed decisions , " said SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt .
The SEC 's goal , he added , was to create " one system where one price could be available to everybody . "
The director of the SEC 's division of market regulation , Richard Lindsey , said Wall Street firms will probably need to spend about $ <number> million to carry out the improvements called for by the new rules .
In proposing the rules last year , the SEC noted that while technology has improved , commonplace practices still existed that worked against investors ' best interests .
It noted that customers whose orders were not displayed lost the chance of getting the best possible price available in the market .
It also cited the potential problem of a two-tiered market in which market makers quote one price to public investors while quoting better prices in private systems , thus robbing investors without access to " hidden " quotes the benefit of the best available prices .
Earlier this month , the SEC settled charges of alleged malpractices on Nasdaq when the parent of the Nasdaq market , the National Association of Securities Dealers , agreed to spend $ <number> million over five years to upgrade its oversight of brokers ' trading practices .
The SEC dropped a third proposal that would have allowed investors with market orders to trade at a better price if there were shifts in prices before their orders were executed .
The agency said it would monitor effects of the two new rules before considering the " price improvement " proposal again .
The agency also proposed rule changes that would require continuous " bid " and " ask " quotations from exchange specialists and market makers who trade more than <number> percent of a stock during any quarter on Nasdaq .
The SEC 's limit order display rule will mean a major change for Nasdaq , where such orders have never been displayed .
The president of the Nasdaq , Alfred Berkeley , was to hold a news conference Wednesday afternoon to elaborate on the new rules ' effects on the market , the second largest in the world .

The police spokesman said he was not sure whether any more passengers were still trapped in the wreckage .
Doctors and medical staff from a hospital across the road from the station were at the scene of the accident within minutes and were able to treat the injured quickly , he added .
Greater damage was averted as the driver of the passenger train had time to apply his emergency brakes before the collision occurred , a state railways spokesman told Austrian news agency APA .

Saskatchewan Wheat Pool eyes hog market .
WINNIPEG <number>
Canada 's largest grain handling firm said Wednesday it expects to forge a partnership with hog farmers by <number> with a view to expanding the company 's scope into pork production .
" Saskatchewan is well positioned to take advantage of growing world markets for pork , " Saskatchewan Wheat Pool chief executive Don Loewen said in a company statement .
SWP said it was analyzing potential partnerships with hog farmers and expected the first deal to be in place in <number> .
The end of Canada 's rail freight subsidy last year caused a shift in feed grain production to the eastern Prairie .
Analysts said livestock production would likely shift to the eastern Prairie rather than feed grains being shipped to the western Prairie .
SWP said it may develop pork production systems that provide farmers with large integrated units , and it may consider contracting programs between producers and packers which would operate within the existing hog market framework .
Saskatchewan Pork International Marketing Group has an export monopoly but some Saskatchewan farmers earlier this month called for an open market in hogs .

TENNIS - SERIOUS MEDVEDEV IS HAVING FUN AGAIN .
Richard Finn
NEW YORK <number>
Outspoken Andrei Medvedev exchanged his reputation as the clown prince of tennis on Wednesday for a new no-nonsense attitude that has made life on the courts fun again .
" I think I 'm much more focused on what I have to do , and that 's playing tennis , " Medvedev said after routing Frenchman Jean-Philippe Fleurian <number> <number> <number> in the opening round of the U.S. Open .
It was Medvedev 's sixth victory in a row after winning his first tournament of the year last week at the Hamlet Cup .
" I realised this year , that without putting <number> percent of your mind into tennis , I do n't think you can successful , " said the <number> Medvedev .
" The whole day I 'm thinking abnout tennis .
I felt that all the other things I was doing the years before , they were distracting me , they were not helping me at all . "
For Medvedev that meant confining his post-match comments to tennis and not going off on tirades about about peripheral issues such as the poor quality of food in the players lounge , an entertaining rant that took his mind off the task at hand .
" I know what I 'm here for , " said Medvedev , who lost in the second round of the Open the last two years after reaching the quarters in <number> , the same year he tried his hand as a restaurant critic .
" I 'm not here to fight the press or talk about the food or entertain the people off the court .
I 'm here to play tennis and to win .
I have much less fun off the court .
I have much more fun on the court , " he said .
Just three years ago Medvedev was one of the world 's best , with a ranking of six after reaching the French Open semifinal and winning three tournaments .
But Medvedev 's ranking slowly began to drop last year as he struggled with a wrist injury .
The Ukrainian finally hit a low of <number> two months ago .
" It 's somewhere where I would n't like to stay very long , " Medvedev said of his current ranking of <number> . "
It 's a part of the penalty that I have to accept . "
As part of his new businesslike approach , Medvedev hired Australian coach Bob Brett at the start of this year and the partnership is beginning to pay off .
" At the beginning of the year we started from zero , " said Medvedev . "
Winning in Long Island ( last week ) was like winning for the first time . "
While Medvedev 's <number> romp past Fleurian was rather ordinary , the fact that the two were playing each other was rather remarkable .
In the original draw , Medvedev and Fleurian were slotted to play each other .
When controversy forced the draw to be done over -- against odds of <number> -- Medvedev and Fleurian drew each other a second time .
" When I saw the new draw I did n't have to change my preparation , " Medvedev said . "
I think it 's destined that it turned out for me . "

TENNIS - GRAF WORKS HARD FOR FIRST-ROUND WIN .
Bill Berkrot
NEW YORK <number>
It was n't supposed to be this hard for defending champion Steffi Graf to win her opening match at the U.S. Open on Tuesday night .
But the script that called for the usual first-round demolition by the top-ranked top seed was rewritten by <number> Indonesian Yayuk Basuki playing with nothing to lose abandon .
Graf , of course , prevailed <number> <number> , but not before some tense moments that even had the German superstar thinking the match was going three sets .
" I won the second set , which I did n't think I would do , being down <number> and the chances she had at <number> , " Graf recalled .
Several of the other women 's seeds eased into the second round with more typical Graf-like efficiency Tuesday .
As afternoon turned to evening , fourth-seeded Spaniard Conchita Martinez took apart Romanian Ruxandra Dragomir in <number> minutes with the loss of just two games , one more than second seed Monica Seles , who opened the second-day programme by crushing American Anne Miller <number> <number> .
Third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario , the <number> champion , and eighth-seeded Olympic gold medalist Lindsay Davenport dropped three game each en route to the second round .
But the day was not without its seeded casualties on the women 's side .
Fifth-seed Iva Majoli of Croatia was picked off by Austrian Judith Wiesner and Wimbledon semifinalist Kimiko Date of Japan , the <number> seed , fell <number> <number> to <number> American Kimberly Po .
Date 's defeat left no other seeded players in Seles 's quarter of the draw , which lost Anke Huber ( <number> ) and Maggie Maleeva ( <number> ) on Monday .
But Graf , winner of <number> Grand Slam titles , was not about to join that list .
" At some points I felt a little nervous , " she admitted . "
When it came down to the important points , I felt more confident . "
Basuki , a first-round loser here for the fifth consecutive year , was clearly going for winners , hitting the lines and running Graf around the court as she broke the top seed twice in the second set to grab that shocking <number> lead .
Graf ran off the next three games to restore some semblance of order .
But Basuki , her long black ponytail flying as she raced for shots , held her serve and twice had set point on Graf 's serve at <number> before the German unleashed a forehand pass to force the tie-break .
" I lost the moment , " lamented Basuki , who has reached the fourth round at Wimbledon four times and was a semifinalist in Montreal earlier this month .
Still , the feisty Indonesian got off to a <number> lead in the tie-breaker before a pair of costly double faults gave Graf her chance to avoid a third set .
" Usually in the first one or two matches , you want to find your rhythm and want to get into it , " said Graf , who won seven of the last eight points in the breaker .
" To be in that situation today , a couple of times having to play well , get down and play point-by-point , definitely is a good start . "

Atletico came within a whisker of taking the Cup on the away-goal rule but squandered several chances after going <number> ahead <number> minutes from the end .
Juan Lopez gave Atletico the lead midway through the first half after Barcelona fullback Albert Ferrer and substitute goalkeeper Julen Lopetegui failed to clear a Milinko Pantic cross .
Barcelona 's Hristo Stoichkov made his only significant contribution of the evening <number> minutes after halftime when Sergi Barjuan broke down the right to set up the fiery Bulgarian with a simple equaliser .
But Atletico struck back almost immediately through new signing Juan Eduardo Esnaider and then Serbian set-piece specialist Pantic made it <number> with a superb free-kick in the <number> minute .
Robson praised Atletico after the game , which was played in the Community of Madrid athletic stadium because of pitch problems at the Vicente Calderon ground .

SOCCER - SMICER 'S LAST-GASP GOAL KEEPS LENS IN THE LEAD .
PARIS <number>
Euro <number> star Vladimir Smicer of the Czech Republic scored at the last second for Lens , allowing them to retain the lead in the French soccer league on Wednesday .
Smicer pushed the ball home in injury time to lead his team to a <number> victory over Montpellier , who were leading <number> until Cameroon 's Marc-Vivien Foe equalised on a header in the <number> minute .
The win was the fourth in as many matches this season for Lens , who lead the table on <number> points .
In-form Paris St Germain , who dismissed Nantes <number> , are second with <number> points .
Along with Smicer , Robert Pires was the star of the night in France , scoring the first hat-trick of the league season in Metz 's <number> home victory over neighbouring Strasbourg .
Pires , one of the most promising strikers in the country , was called up for the first time this week by French manager Aime Jacquet for a friendly against Mexico on Saturday at the Parc des Princes .
Pires scored first with a powerful shot in the <number> minute before striking again from close range just before the break .
A solitary raid allowed him to score his third in the <number> .
Smicer 's goal was as hard-won as his team 's victory .
Spurred by Foe 's leveller five minutes before , Lens pressed hard and Foe hit the crossbar in the dying seconds on another header .
The ball bounced back to Smicer 's feet and he scored .
Montpellier seized an unexpected lead thanks to Kader Ferhaoui in the fourth minute after a blunder from Lens goalkeeper Jean-Claude Nadon .
The side from northern France , forced to fight an uphill battle from then on , pulled level thanks to Tony Vairelles in the eighth minute but young striker Fabien Lefevre made it two for Montpellier five minutes later .
League favourites PSG scored a convincing <number> win over Nantes and confirmed they would again be the team to beat this season .
Ironically , PSG 's victory owed a lot to two former Nantes players , striker Patrice Loko , who scored on a brilliant shot in the <number> minute , and defender Benoit Cauet , who started the one-two which allowed Loko to score .
The Parisians , who have yet to concede a goal , were without Brazil 's Leonardo and Panama 's Julio Cesar Dely Valdes , both called up by their national sides .
For Nantes , who shocked PSG to win the league crown two years ago , the fall is very painful .
The Canaries , who lost most of their key players within two years , have yet to win a match this season .
Reigning champions Auxerre had to settle for a goalless draw against Marseille on Tuesday .

S.AFRICAN TRUTH BODY TO SUMMON APARTHEID POLICE .
CAPE TOWN <number>
South Africa 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission said on Wednesday it would subpoena persons accused of human rights violations to appear before it .
" We can subpoena anyone we want to , even the president of the country , " spokesman John Allen told Reuters . "
Subpoenas are due to be served on a number of people this week . "
Media reports have speculated that the commission , which is trying to heal the wounds of apartheid by confronting the past , could subpoena apartheid-era President P.W. Botha and former police generals Basie Smit and Johan Van Der Merwe .
In submissions last week to the commission National Party leader and former president F.W. De Klerk said he had received no co-operation from Botha in compiling his party 's report .
Since it began work in April the commission has been hearing harrowing tales from the victims of apartheid-era abuses , by both the white minority regime and its opponents .
It also wants to hear from those who committed the abuses , to whom it can offer amnesty in return for frankness .
Hopes that reformed perpetrators would come forward voluntarily have faded but the commission has the legal power to force them to appear .
Allen declined to give say who would be subpoenaed .
" At the moment we have a preliminary list of less than <number> people , but this is just the beginning , " he said .
The commission was set up last year to probe <number> years of human-rights violations during the apartheid era .
It is chaired by Nobel Peace winner , retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu .
Allen said the commission could announce the names of subpoenaed persons on Monday next week .

A third well drilled in this area , the Trax et al Morinville <number> , encountered the Leduc Reef but tested wet .
At the company 's Nordegg prospect , the Apache et al Saunders <number> , has reached total depth in the Leduc Reef at approximately <number> feet and has been abandoned , Arch said .

U.S. judge orders Biogen , Berlex officials deposed .
Leslie Gevirtz
BOSTON <number>
In order to help him decide whether he should hear the case , a U.S. District Court judge Wednesday ordered the legal counsels of Biogen Inc and Berlex Laboratories , a subsidiary of Schering AG , deposed .
The tempest beyond the test tube involves allegations that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration violated the Orphan Drug law by allowing Biogen the right to sell its multiple sclerosis drug Avonex .
Berlex also charges that Avonex is so similar to its MS drug , Betaseron , that it is a patent infringement .
Both drugs are types of interferon .
One analyst said sales of Avonex had already cut into Betaseron market share .
BioVest Research , Inc 's analyst Eddie Hedaya said , " Berlex sales are losing share like mad ...
my understanding of the marketplace is that they 're below expectations . "
He added Chiron Corp reported its sales of inventory to Berlex was down .
Chiron makes Betaseron ; Berlex markets it , he said .
Biogen , in its Securities and Exchange Commission quarterly report for the period ending June <number> , said it had earned $ <number> million from Avonex sales during the drugs first six weeks on the market .
When it approved Avonex in May , the FDA said both Biogen 's product and Betaseron were developed under the incentives of the Ophran Drug Act which provides seven years of marketing exclusivity for products that treat rare diseases .
Avonex " has been allowed to enter the market because it differs from interferon <number> ( Betaseron ) ..
. "
the FDA said .
Now , U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf has ordered the chief counsel for Biogen , Michael Astrue , and Robert Chabora , his counterpart at Berlex be deposed about a May <number> meeting the two men attended to help him determine whether the lawsuit filed by Biogen against Berlex should be heard in Massachusetts .
Berlex filed a lawsuit against Biogen in U.S. District Court in Newark , N.J. in July , but Biogen had already filed a suit against Berlex in Massachusetts in May .
Wolf ordered the depositions to determine if he or U.S. District Judge John Bissell of Newark should preside over the case .

Guinea launched a drive on Wednesday to rid the civil service payroll of fictitious workers as part of new prime minister Sidia Toure 's campaign to cut government spending .

Marc Dutroux , the chief accused in a Belgian child murder and sex abuse scandal , is suspected of murdering a young Slovak woman , the Slovak office of Interpol said on Wednesday .
Rudolf Gajdos , head of Slovak Interpol , told a news conference Dutroux was also believed to have planned the kidnapping of at least one Slovak woman .
" One of the police versions in the case of the murder of young gypsy woman in Topolcany , western Slovakia , this July , is a suspicion that Mark Dutroux could have been involved in the murder , " Gajdos said without elaborating on the age of the victim and on the other versions .
Slovak police , Interpol , and Belgian police have been following leads on Dutroux 's activities in Slovakia and the neighbouring Czech Republic where he is known to have made frequent visits .
Gajdos said the police sketch of the suspected murderer was " <number> percent identical with Dutroux 's portrait " , and that Dutroux was known to have been in Topolcany around the time of the woman 's murder .
" Topolcany and the area around this town were reported to have been the most visited places by Dutroux and his accomplices in Slovakia , " Gajdos said .
Dutroux , a convicted child rapist and unemployed father-of-three , led police <number> days ago to the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo in the garden of another of the six houses he owns around the southern Belgian city of Charleroi .
" The Belgian police also informed us that Dutroux , together with one other man , had ( also ) planned the kidnapping of at least one Slovak woman , " Gajdos said .
" The plan apparently failed due to difficulties in crossing the border , " he added , but did not elaborate .
The Slovak police are also investigating visits by about <number> Slovak women , aged <number> to <number> , to Belgium , at the invitation of Dutroux .
The women said they went to Belgium voluntarily and police suspect they were used to act in pornographic films , Gajdos said earlier this week .

Exiled Bosnians protest confusing voting rules .
Duncan Shiels
NAGYATAD , Hungary <number>
Bosnian refugees in Hungary , the first to vote last weekend in their country 's first post-war election , found the rules confusing and some had no idea who they voted for , refugees and officials said on Wednesday .
" For the most part they really did n't understand what was going on , " the director of the Nagyatad camp Lajos Horvath told Reuters on Wednesday .
" It was confusing , they had no experience of voting , many of the refugees are only semi-literate and none of them knew anything about the candidates , " he said .
" They just voted along ethnic lines where they could . "
The Bosnian election is set for September <number> and voting began on Wednesday for most of the <number> Bosnians living abroad .
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which is running the election , allowed the ballot to be held on Sunday in four Hungarian refugee camps .
Some Moslem refugees among the <number> registered voters Hungary 's largest camp Nagyatad have written to the OSCE complaining that they were unable to vote in contests for the president or assembly of the Bosnian-Croat Federation , where most Moslems live .
This was because their pre-war homes are now in the Serb-controlled territory , so they were voting for the national assembly of the Republika Srbska , most of the candidates for which are Serbs .
For the foreign powers which back last year 's Dayton peace agreement , the main point of the election rules is that by voting as though they were still in their pre-war homes , Bosnians should override the effects of ethnic cleansing and reassert the concept of a single multi-ethnic state .
But Adem Hodzic , one of the refugees who signed the letter of complaint , told Reuters :
" We only realised after voting that we were being denied the rights of other Bosnian Moslems to choose our president .
This vote seals the division of my country . "
Under the election rules citizens vote for a three-man presidency and House of Representatives for all Bosnia-Hercegovina and for assemblies and cantonal seats in either the Moslem-Croat Federation or the Republika Srbska .
On Sunday voters in Hungary also cast ballots for municipal councils but these will be invalidated following the cancellation of local elections by the OSCE on Tuesday .
Husein Micijevic , who also signed the letter , alleged that elderly voters were directed who to vote for by Hungarian translators who stood in the polling booth to help them .
" Probably <number> refugees were shown where to put their cross , " he said .
Seventy eight-year-old Mandolina Zelic , a Bosnian Croat who has spent the last five years in Nagyatad , told Reuters she had cast her ballot because she 'd been told to by the camp authorities but had no idea who she voted for .
" At first the organisers would n't let anyone help me but when they saw I did n't understand a young translator ringed the names I had to mark , " she said . "
I do n't know who I voted for . "
Maria Szabo of the Hungarian office organising the elections on behalf of the OSCE told Reuters on Wednesday her office was studying the letter but said they had followed OSCE instructions very carefully .
" The envelopes , each with the five different voting slips , were sealed until voting and had written instructions on how to vote , " she said . "
But of course those who could not read had to be shown . "

Lebed likely to fail on Chechnya - Polish minister .

Russian security chief Aleksander Lebed faces an almost impossible task in Chechnya and is likely to be sidelined , Polish Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati was reported as saying on Wednesday .
According to best-selling daily Gazeta Wyborcza , Rosati told the Polish parliament 's foreign affairs committee on Tuesday that the fact Lebed had been charged with resolving the conflict in Chechnya showed he would be marginalised .
" It is almost impossible to gain success in this , " it quoted Rosati as saying during a committee debate .
" Lebed has no diplomatic experience .
Yeltsin sent him there to compromise him .
This tactical manoeuvre also shows that in the ruling circle there is no unity of action , " he said .
Lebed , who has arranged a military truce with separatist rebels in the southern Russia region , was in Moscow this week seeking support for a deal on Chechnya 's political status .
But Russian President Boris Yeltsin has seemed unwilling to meet his envoy and went on holiday on Monday .
Gazeta Wyborcza quoted Rosati as saying Yeltsin was very ill and effectively on leave , but for now retained control in Russia although matters were passing into the hands of his close collaborators .
Rosati said Russia 's July polls , in which Yeltsin won re-election , showed democracy had passed an important test and the Russian people had chosed the path of further reforms .
But he said a power struggle in Russia 's ruling circles could not be ruled out , which could harm further reforms .
He expressed concern over problems in the Russian economy , saying this could lead to social unrest , the daily reported .

A top judicial official and critic of President Ernesto Samper accused the government of indifference on Wednesday over efforts to lift Colombia 's five-year-old ban on extradition .
" It would seem that the subject of extradition is unworthy of an opinion from the government , " Deputy Prosecutor-General Adolfo Salamanca said .
Constitutional reforms were proposed on Tuesday by two senators , one of them a member of Samper 's own Liberal Party , aimed at lifting the ban on extradition introduced in <number> .
U.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette applauded the move , saying it could prompt the Clinton administration to remove Colombia from a list of outcast nations that have failed to cooperate in U.S. counternarcotics efforts .
Samper -- who weathered a year-old crisis stemming from charges he financed his <number> election campaign with drug money -- appeared less than enthusiastic , however .
" Extradition is not on the government 's legislative agenda , " he told reporters on Tuesday .
He added that he did not oppose the idea of opening a public debate over the issue .
But he fell far short of endorsing the idea of putting Colombian drug lords onto U.S.-bound flights to serve stiff penalities in American prisons .
Salamanca , who spoke at a meeting on kidnapping in Colombia , has said in the past that there was ample evidence to prove that Samper 's campaign received millions of dollars in contributions from the country 's top drug lords .

PLO Council calls for halt to contacts with Israel .
RAMALLAH , West Bank <number>
The Palestinian Legislative Council on Wednesday called for a halt to contacts with Israel , just hours after President Yasser Arafat said the Jewish state had effectively declared war on the Palestinians by pursuing its hardline policies .
A resolution released by the council called for " halting contacts with the Israeli side and leaving the mechanism to carry out this to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat " .
The council was meeting in Ramallah to discuss Israel 's new policy of Jewish settlement expansion and its uncompromising line on Jerusalem since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June .
Council resolutions are not necessarily binding .
Arafat had earlier blasted Israel saying its policies amounted to a declaration of war against the Palestinian people .
He also called for the first general strike in two years in the West Bank and Gaza on Thursday .
" What happened concerning continuous violations and crimes from this new Israeli leadership means they are declaring a state of war against the Palestinian people , " Arafat told the council .
Council speaker Ahmed Korei said the decision was part of a comprehensive plan to confront Israeli settlement policy , land confiscation and what he termed other violations of the Israeli-PLO peace deals .

An Iraqi Kurdish group on Wednesday said it had agreed a new U.S.-brokered ceasefire with a rival faction after a previous accord was shattered by sporadic fighting between the groups in recent days .

The KDP , led by Massoud Barzani , had said a previous ceasefire negotiated by Pelletreau last Friday was broken by the PUK .
Talabani has agreed to take part in talks in London on reaching a comprehensive settlement for the PUK-KDP conflict , the PUK statement said .

ANKARA <number>
An Iraqi Kurdish group on Wednesday said Iraq was massing troops near Kurdish regions in the north , where a U.S.-led allied air force protects the local population against attacks from Baghdad .
" The Iraqi regime has started threatening the Kurdish population by massing troops in preparation to attack Kurdish towns and population centres , " the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) said in a statement .
The PUK said it had received confirmed reports that Iraqi troops , supported by tanks , artillery and armoured vehicles , have already penetrated some Kurdish areas .
It said the military presence reflects cooperation between President Saddam Hussein and the PUK 's rival , the Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) .
The PUK statement follows KDP assertions that the PUK is receiving military support from Iran .
Hostilities between the two warring Iraqi Kurdish factions have continued in the last few days despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire last Friday .
The PUK called on the United Nations and allied forces to halt the Iraqi aggression .

Iraq says hijackers were not diplomats .
BAGHDAD <number>
Iraq on Wednesday said the hijackers of a Sudanese airliner were not Iraqi diplomats and added that " noble Iraqis " would never contemplate such an action .
The official Iraqi News Agency ( INA ) quoted Iraq 's ambassador in Khartoum as saying that Iraq 's embassy in the Sudanese capital had nothing to do with the Monday night hijacking .
Iraq 's ambassador in Khartoum denounced the hijacking and described it as a terrorist act which had nothing to do " with the morals and values of noble Iraqis , " INA said .
Ambassador Abdulsamad Hameed Ali told INA there was only one diplomat among the <number> passengers and crew on the Sudan Airways Airbus .
" He was not involved ...
on the contrary he was harassed by the elements which carried out the hijacking , " he said .
INA did not say the hijackers were Iraqis .
The hijack started when the flight left Khartoum for Amman on Monday night .
The hijackers told the crew they had grenades and other explosives and threatened to blow up the plane if they were not taken to London .
The airliner refuelled at Larnaca , Cyprus and landed at London 's Stansted airport in the early hours of Tuesday .
Seven Iraqi suspected hijackers surrendered and British police said they had apparently asked for political asylum .
Several had brought their families along , including children .

Dole blasts Clinton for ignoring teen drug use .
Judith Crosson
VENTURA , Calif. <number>
Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole Wednesday accused the Clinton administration of ignoring drug use among teenagers and said if elected he would use the National Guard to stop drugs from entering the United States .
" He 'll probably mention his war on drugs , which he 's going to start like everything else -- next year .
It 's too late , Mr. President , " Dole told an outdoor crowd of several hundred at a private religious school .
He also commented briefly on published reports that the administration was planning to announce a plan to lower capital gains taxes for home sales . "
Welcome to the club .
We 've had it out there for weeks and weeks and weeks , " Dole said .
Dole said former first lady Nancy Reagan was laughed at with her " just say no " anti-drug message . "
But it worked , " Dole said .
Meanwhile , in Los Angeles , Dole 's running mate , Jack Kemp , campaigned aggressively for the black vote in an area that was the flashpoint of the <number> Los Angeles riots .
Kemp told a crowd of about <number> African Americans in south central Los Angeles , " Keep your eyes open , keep your ears open , keep your heart open .
I want to tell you with all my heart that we want to win your vote . "
In Dole 's address to a group that was largely white , the presidential nominee likened the stream of illegal drugs into the United States to missiles aimed at American children and promised to appoint federal judges who would be tough on illegal drug use .
" They 're aiming millions and millions of missiles right at these young people , whether it 's a needle , whether it 's a cigarette , whatever the delivery system is -- it 's poison and it 's got to stop in America . "
he said .
Dole said <number> percent of the cocaine that entered the United States and <number> percent of the marijuana came from Mexico . "
We 've got an international problem and I 'm prepared to use our military might .
We want to stop drugs at the border , " he said .
Dole 's remarks prompted questions about whether he was seeking a ban on cigarettes . "
I did n't say anything about cigarettes .
I was talking about drugs .
I said you should n't smoke either .
That 's all I said , " he replied as he was shaking hands with well-wishers .
When asked specifically if he was suggesting a ban on cigarettes , Dole replied : " Oh no .
Come on , you know better than that . "
Dole campaign aides said the candidate was telling young people not to smoke .
Dole also said he opposed California Proposition <number> which , if approved by voters , would allow the cultivation of marijuana plants for medicinal uses .
Dole said the initiative would allow marijuana to be used for anything from a headache to an ingrown toenail .
In an effort to paint the drug issue in non-political terms , Dole said three times during his <number> address that illegal drug use was neither a Democratic nor a Republican issue but one that involves all people .
The anti-drug message is a theme Dole feels has strong voter appeal .
On Sunday near Chicago he accused President Bill Clinton of " raising the white flag " in the war on drugs .
A recent survey showed that illegal drug use among <number> year-olds had doubled in the past four years .
Dole was flanked by several California Republican politicians including Gov .
Pete Wilson , who said local and state governments cannot fight illegal drugs alone .
" We need all the help we can get .
We need to get the kind of help we used to get when Ronald Reagan and George Bush were in the White House , " Wilson said .

WHEAT--Rains boost U.S. HRW planting prospects .

KANSAS CITY , Mo .
<number>
Above-normal summer rainfall in the U.S. High Plains has produced near-ideal conditions for planting the <number> hard red winter wheat crop , analysts said Wednesday .
From central Texas north to Kansas , rains throughout July and August have relieved most of the drought conditions that plagued the region earlier this year .
" Our moisture situation is excellent , especially for fall planting of winter wheat , " said Kim Anderson , extension wheat marketing economist at Oklahoma State University .
The irony of the above-average summer rainfall was not lost on High Plains wheat producers , who only three months ago were caught in a drought so severe that old-timers likened conditions to the " Dust Bowl " days of the <number> .
" It 's definitely a turnabout from this past year , but you know last year we had pretty good moisture about this time of year , and then about October <number> it quit , " said Mark Hodges , executive director of the Oklahoma Wheat Commission . "
Hopefully that 's not going to happen this year . "
According to figures released by the Oklahoma Climatological Survey , an average of <number> inches fell across the state between March <number> and August <number> , <number> .
That 's about <number> inch above the average for the same time period , according to Howard Johnson , associate state climatologist at the University of Oklahoma .
He noted that the majority of that <number> inches had fallen since July .
As an example of just how dry it was , data showed that between October <number> , <number> and March <number> , <number> , the state received an average of only <number> inches of rainfall .
In northern Texas , the current rainfall situation was similar to most of Oklahoma , said Rodney Mosier , executive assistant for the Texas Wheat Producers .
" Up here in the Texas Panhandle , we 've had some extremely beneficial rains that came through within the last several days and are really setting us up for ideal conditions for planting wheat , " Mosier said .
But he warned that the situation was not as ideal in central and southern Texas , where mositure levels were still short despite the rains brought by Hurricane Dolly last week .
In Kansas , typically the number one U.S. hard red winter wheat producer , topsoil moisture levels were rated mostly adequate during the week ended Sunday , according to the state 's agricultural statistics service .
In its weekly report released Monday , the service said Kansas topsoil moisture was rated eight percent surplus , <number> percent adequate and <number> percent short to very short .
Oklahoma 's Agricultural Statistics Service showed similar conditions , rating topsoil moisture levels as seven percent surplus , <number> percent adequate and <number> percent short to very short .
Data on topsoil moisture ratings were not released by the Texas Agricultural Statistics Service .

Burundi defends military regime to hostile UN .
Evelyn Leopold
UNITED NATIONS <number>
Burundi 's ambassador on Wednesday lashed out at economic sanctions imposed by African states and said any thought of an arms embargo would be a windfall for guerrillas fighting his army-run government .
In a lengthy debate on Burundi before the U.N. Security Council , Ambassador Nsanze Terence said the new military government took over to stabilise the country and wanted negotiations under former Tanzanian President Julius Nyrere .
Nearly every African member who spoke , as well as most Security Council members , however , were unsympathetic towards the government of President Pierre Buyoya , an army major put in power in a July coup by the Tutsi-run military , which is locked in a guerrilla war with the majority Hutus .
" These ( African ) brothers should have been the first to bind the wounds of Burundi , " Terence said of the economic embargo . "
Quite the contrary , Burundi has seen economic war declared against it by fellow African people ... a gratuitous immolation of the people of Burundi . "
He said his government had just asked U.N. human rights monitors to increase their numbers in Burundi in an effort " to put an end to this vicious circle of violence . "
More than <number> people have been killed in violence between the minority Tutsis and the majority Hutus since <number> .
Botswana 's envoy , Mothusi Nkgowe , said coups should be relegated " to the dump heap of history " as there could be no justification for the overthrow of a legitimate government .
Chile has proposed a resolution , still under discussion , that would impose an immediate arms embargo on Burundi and call for negotiations .
The draft suggests further sanctions against those who impede a political solution .
Among the council 's five permanent members , Russia and the United States appeared to support most elements of the Chilean proposal , while Britain , France and China were cautious .
Terence , a Tutsi , said any arms embargo would leave the army unable to defend itself against Hutu guerrillas and leave the population exposed to " armed terroritsts . "
But Chilean Ambassador Juan Somavia said : " Every weapon that reached Burundi is a weapon aimed mainly at killing an unarmed civilian .
We must not send a signal different from the African leaders themselves .
Inaction is becoming the worst possible course of action . "
Burundi 's parliament has been suspended and political parties are banned but Terence told reporters Buyoya would reconvene a new type of national assembly in October .
The United States said the coup leaders had taken no steps to restore democracy and indiscriminate killings continued .
Ambassador Karl Inderfurth said the new government should have " unconditional " negotiations with all parties inside and outside of the country .
He said Washington strongly supported the economic sanctions imposed already and if these did not work the council would consider " an arms embargo or targeted sanctions against faction leaders . "
But he said the international community had to be prepared for the worst and avoid a replay of the horrors in neighbouring Rwanda , where widespread genocide broke out against the Tutsis two years ago .
He again said the United Nations should draw up contingency plans for a rapid humanitarian intervention .

Indian fishermen said on Wednesday they had been forced at gunpoint to ferry refugees fleeing the ethnic war in Sri Lanka to India , as a protest strike by more than <number> fishermen entered its ninth day .
" There is little we can do when at mid-sea .
The LTTE ( Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ) accosts us and , at the point of a gun , forces us to take refugees , " said senior fishermen leader P. Arulanandam .
Some <number> refugees have landed in recent weeks at the port of Rameswaram in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu , home to <number> million Tamil-speaking people , port officials say .
Rameswaram is <number> km ( <number> miles ) off the coast of Sri Lanka .

But the influx has triggered fears of a repeat of the <number> when some <number> refugees landed in Tamil Nadu .
Intelligence officals said more than <number> Tamils were waiting on the western coast of Sri Lanka to cross into India .
The Indian government has warned its fishermen that their boats would be impounded if they were caught ferrying refugees .
The fishermen went on strike last week to protest the government 's cancellation of three trawlers ' fishing licenses after the boats were caught carrying Tamil refugees .
All Fishermen 's Association secretary N.J. Bose said the strike would continue indefinitely and the fishermen would block road and rail traffic if their demands were not met .
" Until the government releases our boats from naval custody and Sri Lankan naval custody , and gives us assurance ( it will not revoke licences of boats ferrying refugees ) , we will not call off our strike , " Bose said .
LTTE spokesmen could not immediately be reached for comment , but Sri Lankan fishermen denied that Indians were being coerced into carrying refugees across the Palk Strait .
" Indian fishermen come right up to Pesalai to fish , and when refugees request them to ferry them across , they readily oblige .
Only some take money , " Sri Lankan boatman Chinnathambi said .
Arulanandam denied the fishermen charged the refugees for passage to India and said it was unfair to penalise them for the refugees ' arrival .
" We have not gone to sea since August <number> , but refugees are arriving daily nevertheless .
How could we alone be held responsible for the influx ? "
he said .
An Indian Fisheries Department official said the government planned to urge fishermen not to cross the international boundary between India and Sri Lanka , but admitted this would be hard to enforce because of Sri Lanka 's pomfret-rich waters .

MILTIADIS EVERT HEADS TO ALEXANDROUPOLIS THIS WEEKEND .
ATHENS <number>
Conservative New Democracy ( ND ) party leader Miltiadis Evert will be hitting the campaign trail and head to Alexandroupolis this weekend to speak to the city 's businessmen on Sunday morning , ND said .
Evert will depart for Alexandroupolis on Saturday afternoon .
Prime Minister Costas Simitis criticized Evert today for unleashing a seven-point economic package that offers tax relief to merchants and other professionals , higher pensions to farmers and support for small business .
The finance ministry estimated the cost of ND 's economic measures to over <number> billion drachmas but ND officials put the figure much lower to about <number> billion drachmas .
Simitis blamed ND for the low absorption rate of EU funds and said the socialists will increase farmers ' pensions , combat tax evasion and accelerate GDP growth rates to <number> percent in a few years .
Faster economic growth is a major component of ND 's economic programme and Evert has repeatedly blamed the socialists for the slow economic growth .

Dow pushes London stocks to new record .
Peter Griffiths
LONDON <number>
A firm start on Wall Street helped push leading London shares to a new record high on Wednesday and German stocks closed floor trading up but the Paris bourse slipped sharply , hit by a weakening franc and fears of industrial unrest .
On the foreign exchange markets , a survey indicating weaker than expected Japanese business sentiment boosted the dollar in early trading but it failed to build on its gains against the yen and slipped lower against the mark in quiet afternoon trade .
London shares , boosted by Wall Street , added to early gains with the blue chip FTSE <number> index hitting a new peak of <number> before dropping back slightly .
One focus was British Airways , which rebounded after fears faded that the cancellation of " open skies " talks between the U.S. Transportation Department and the British government may jeopardise its tie-up with American Airlines .
The conclusion of an open skies agreement had been made a prerequisite of the proposed link-up by the U.S .
Better-than-expected British trade figures had little impact on equities .
The non-EU July trade deficit totalled <number> million sterling ( $ <number> million ) while June 's world deficit was <number> billion pounds .
Forecasts were for deficits of <number> million sterling and <number> billion sterling .
German shares shed some gains on profit-taking but nonetheless ended the floor session higher buoyed by demand for chemical stocks and a stable dollar .
The <number> DAX index closed at <number> points , up <number> .
However , French stocks extended opening losses to more than one percent in morning trading , falling through the <number> point resistance level on the main <number> index .
Dealers blamed a weakening franc and worries about the <number> budget and possible autumn strikes
Louis Viannet , leader of France 's Communist-led CGT union , criticised government plans for spending cuts in the <number> budget on Wednesday and warned of labour unrest as France gets back to work after the holidays .
Later in the day , helped by the firmer Wall Street opening , Paris climbed back to the <number> level but still remained well into negative territory .
In foreign exchange the dollar was trading at around <number> yen in the European afternoon , up from its European close on Tuesday of <number> but off the day 's highs .
It had been boosted overnight by the Bank of Japan 's quarterly corporate survey , or " tankan " , of major manufacturers -- an important gauge of business sentiment .
The unexpectedly weak figures convinced markets that Japanese interest rates would stay at rock-bottom levels -- weakening the yen .
The Japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of <number> percent .
The BOJ sought to put the best face on the data which defied economists ' predictions of improving sentiment and was the first decline in business sentiment in a year .
A BOJ spokesman said " the doors to the recovery have not been shut ...
the recovery is still continuing . "
These remarks gave the yen some backbone and the dollar failed to progress further .
" The dollar 's gains were less than spectacular , suggesting that while it 's likely to benefit from revised Japanese rate expectations , a breakout from the established trading range does n't appear likely , " said currency economist Klaus Baader .
Dealers said shares were also affected by a slippage in bond prices due to lower than expected June industrial production , showing the economy was still faltering .

Arafat says Israel declares war on Palestinians .
Wafa Amr
RAMALLAH , West Bank <number>
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said on Wednesday that Israel had declared war on the Palestinians and called for the first general strike in the West Bank and Gaza in two years .
" What happened concerning continuous violations and crimes from this new Israeli leadership means they are declaring a state of war against the Palestinian people , " Arafat told the Palestinian legislature .
Accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of stupidity , Arafat launched his strongest attack on the right-wing government since its election in May .
The tirade was sparked by Israel 's announcement on Tuesday of plans to expand the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Sefer and its demolishing of a community centre in Arab East Jerusalem .
" Israel has started the war on Jerusalem .
They are idiots to have started the Jerusalem battle , " Arafat said in Arabic . "
There will be no Palestinian state without Jerusalem .
Netanyahu should know he is stupid to have started this battle . "
Arafat called for a general strike " for Jerusalem " on Thursday in all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
There has not been a joint shutdown there since May <number> when Israeli troops began withdrawing under an interim self-rule agreement signed in <number> .
The strike will have little effect on the Israeli economy while hurting Palestinian merchants in East Jerusalem and Bethlehem who cater to the tourist trade .
Some <number> Palestinian labourers are likely to stay away from their jobs , mainly in construction , in Israel .
But Palestinians , once the backbone of the building industry , have been largely replaced by labourers from Romania and China .
" On Friday , all Moslems , including Palestinians in Israel ...
will go to ( Jerusalem 's ) Al-Aqsa mosque and pray .
Jews and Christians who do not pray should accompany them and stand behind them , " Arafat said .
Officials in Netanyahu 's office were not immediately available for comment on Arafat 's remarks .
Israeli travel restrictions , imposed after bombings by Moslem militants in February and March , ban most of the two million Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza from entering Jerusalem .
Netanyahu , who opposes trading occupied land for peace , made Jerusalem a central issue in his election campaign , accusing Labour Prime Minister Shimon Peres of planning to hand control of the Arab eastern part of the city to the Palestinians .
Israel captured East Jerusalem in the <number> Middle East war and claims both halves of the city as its capital .
The PLO wants East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state .
In his speech to the crowded legislature , Arafat signalled he was not abandoning diplomacy although " alarm bells are ringing " .
He unexpectedly broke off his address to take a telephone call from U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross , who held talks in Paris on Tuesday with Israeli and Egyptian officials .
When Arafat returned to the podium , he said senior PLO negotiator Mahmoud Abbas , better known as Abu Mazen , and Netanyahu aide Dore Gold could meet on Thursday .
He quoted Ross as telling him : " The important thing is the Israelis are prepared to move . "
Arafat said he replied : " is this like their previous promises ? "
" No , they have good intentions , " Arafat quoted Ross as saying .
Palestinians have been pressing Israel to carry out a long-delayed partial troop pullout from the flashpoint West Bank city of Hebron agreed by the previous Labour government .
The Israeli government is studying redeployment plans submitted by Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai which are likely to demand a wider than agreed army presence in Hebron .

US investors mull appeal of Lloyd 's decision .
Patricia Vowinkel
NEW YORK <number>
U.S. investors in troubled Lloyd 's of London were considering late on Tuesday whether to appeal a U.S. court decision in favour of Lloyd 's and pledged to continue pursuing other legal actions .
A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday gave Lloyd 's a reprieve , throwing out an injunction that the insurance giant said could have led to its collapse .
A lower court issued the injunction on Friday and ordered Lloyd 's to give investors , known as Names , more information before requiring them to decide whether to accept a settlement offer as part of a reorganisation plan .
" My prediction is that the Names will appeal , " said Kenneth Chiate , a U.S. Name and a chief negotiator for the American Names Association .
" At this point , it is a sufficiently important decision that I 'm confident that they will appeal , " he said . "
But to say that they definitely will would be premature until we determine what the exact basis for the court 's ruling is . "
Under the reorganisation plan , Lloyd 's plans to reinsure its massive liabilities into a new company called Equitas .
The arrangement calls for investors to make additional payments to fund Equitas but also provides them with <number> billion stg in compensation to help reduce their prior outstanding liabilities .
The Names had been scheduled to decide whether to accept or reject the offer by <number> GMT Wednesday , but Lloyd 's chairman David Rowland said on Tuesday the offer would be extended .
At least eight U.S. states have still some form of litigation pending , said John Head , spokesman for the Association of Lloyd 's State Chairmen , a group representing U.S. Names .
" It goes without saying that we 're rather disappointed , " Head said of the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit , sitting in Baltimore .
But , he said , " we still have hope that somebody is going to see our point of view in this . "
The Colorado attorney general told Lloyd 's last week it was considering a new legal action against the British insurance market , based on allegations of consumer fraud .
" We have notified them of our concerns and asked them to give us a response , " said Colorado attorney general Gale Norton .
Norton said she was concerned that the Lloyd 's agreement immunizes it from future litigation regarding Equitas and requires that all legal actions be heard outside of Colorado .
In addition , she said she was concerned the plan may not offer investors enough protection from additional , future liabilities .
Meanwhile , an appeal of a lawsuit filed by some <number> Names in California is still pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , Chiate of the American Names Association said .
That lawsuit , which seeks rescision and restitution , was dismissed in a U.S. district court .
That case " is what I call the most significant alternate remedy for us , " Chiate said .
The individual Names , however , now must decide whether to accept Lloyd 's settlement offer or reject the offer and pursue litigation .
Chiate said he has advised Names that " they must make , individually , a risk benefit analysis . "
Rejection involved forfeiting the compensation offer and risking the possibility of owing Lloyd 's two to three times more than Lloyd 's is now willing to accept , he said .
But , in rejecting the offer , the Names would retain their rights to pursue litigation , he said .

" We believe that our country will be reduced to nothing if the Khmer people continue to fight against each other indefinitely ....
For this reason we decided to break away from that dictatorial group and found a movement named ' Democratic National United Movement ' , " he said .
Ieng Sary was sentenced to death in absentia for his role in the mass genocide in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge rule of terror between <number> when over a million people were executed or died of starvation , disease or overwork in mass labour camps .

MOF 's Kubo says believes BOJ rate policy unchanged .
TOKYO <number>
Japan 's Finance Minister Wataru Kubo told a news conference on Wednesday that he believes that the Bank of Japan 's ( BOJ ) interest rate policy which is geared towards ensuring economic growth has not changed after the release of the central bank 's " tankan " survey .
The BOJ released the August tankan , its quarterly short-term corporate survey , in the morning and it showed business outlook had worsened .
However , Kubo said it did not necessarily show a substantial worsening of the economy .
" The question is what the BOJ is going to do with its interest rate policy .
The BOJ governor has made it clear that the BOJ 's policy is aimed at ensuring basis for economic recovery .
I believe this policy has not changed , " he said .
Asked if a supplementary budget for <number> was needed to support the economy , Kubo said the tankan results would not lead to any immediate decision on the need for an extra budget .
" I do n't think we should immediately draw a conclusion that the economic recovery has come to a halt or that signs of a economic contraction have emerged , " Kubo said . "
The economy is not recovering smoothly or at a fast pace . "
Kubo said he would make a decision on the need for a supplementary budget after an announcement in mid-September of Japan 's gross domestic product for the April-June quarter .
" I would like to see how the economy moved in the first half of <number> , " he said .

China says militant Japan must face war past .
BEIJING <number>
China on Wednesday called on Japan to acknowledge its wartime past and put a stop to a tide of resurgent militarism to prevent similar atrocities in future .
" Some Japanese are still unrepentant about the atrocities committed by the Japanese militarists during the war , " said a commentary in the official China Daily .
" If they are still undecided whether the war Japan launched was aggressive in nature , it will be difficult to tell whether they will do the same again , " the newspaper said .
China raised indignant protests after several Japanese cabinet ministers visited a shrine dedicated to their country 's war dead on August <number> , the <number> anniversary of Japan 's World War Two surrender .

Japan coalition party leader plans to resign .
TOKYO <number>
The leader of a junior partner in Japan 's three-party ruling coalition plans to resign to quell a political rebellion , party officials said on Wednesday .
The officials said New Party Sakigake President Masayoshi Takemura , finance minister until the beginning of this year , promised his resignation in a meeting with the politician who set off the rebellion in the smallest coalition member .
They said the date of Takemura 's resignation would be determined by party officials .
The Sakigake row has caused jitters in its coalition partners , Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto 's Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , the biggest grouping , and the Social Democratic Party .
But analysts said the row was not expected to immediately destabilise the government as even if Sakigake splits apart it has so few seats a loss of support would not lead to a general election .
The dispute pits Takemura , who founded Sakigake in <number> as a reform-oriented LDP splinter group , against party official Yukio Hatoyama , who says he will leave Sakigake to form a reformist political group next month .
Hatoyama , the <number> grandson of a <number> prime minister , on Tuesday quit as Sakigake secretary general and has publicly snubbed the <number> Takemura , pointedly ruling his mentor out as a possible member of the new political force .
Marathon talks between the two former allies on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning failed to resolve the dispute over the role of Takemura , seen by Hatoyama backers as tainted by his senior role in the LDP-dominated coalition .
The presence of Takemura , whose role as finance minister in passing an unpopular plan to use taxpayer funds to wind up failed housing loan firms ruined his reputation as a reformer , has stalled Hatoyama 's efforts to attract to his new group defectors from the opposition camp , analysts said .
Media reports say that at most <number> of <number> Sakigake members , joined by a handful of Social Democrats , will follow Hatoyama when he bolts -- far short of the <number> lawmakers needed to topple Hashimoto 's eight-month-old government .
Hashimoto -- who returns from a <number> Latin American tour on Saturday -- must call polls by <number> , and has repeatedly said he would not call an early general election .
But many analysts and politicians believe he may dissolve parliament soon after it reconvenes in early October .

With <number> days to go before the British colony reverts to China , the Hong Kong media focused mainly on domestic issues concerning alleged pressure on a judge , cross straights relations and the democratic lobby 's relationship with Beijing .
The Beijing-funded WEN WEI PO said Taiwan 's government could not hope to stem the island 's economic and trade exchanges with China .
The paper said that using administrative power to limit economic activities across the Taiwan strait would not work .
MING PAO DAILY NEWS said it hoped Chinese officials would soon open dialogue with Hong Kong 's Democratic Party and the newly-established democracy lobby , Frontier , in order to ease anxieties in the lead-up to the handover .
The English language SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST said the judiciary needed to take swift and decisive action in investigating the allegations that a judge had been subjected to pressure in a New Zealand immigration case involving allegations of fraud .
The independence of the judiciary and the rule of law were of paramount importance to Hong Kong 's survival as a business centre .
The Chinese language daily HONG KONG ECONOMIC TIMES said the Legal Department had been indecisive in its handling of the judge 's case .
Such hesitancy on the part of the government had damaged public confidence in the rule of law , the paper said .

Iraq balks at U.N. staff for oil-for-food deal .
Evelyn Leopold
UNITED NATIONS <number>
Iraq has balked at the number of U.N. staff needed to implement the oil-for-food deal , blaming the United States for insisting on stringent monitoring .
In comments to reporters and a statement on Tuesday , Iraqi diplomats said the cost of the monitors and other staff , which Baghdad has to finance , surpasses funds allocated for electricity , water , sewers , education and agriculture .
At issue was a May <number> agreement allowing Iraq to sell $ <number> billion worth of oil to purchase badly needed food , medicine and other supplies to ease the impact of sanctions in force since its troops invaded Kuwait in August <number> .
The Iraqi statement said the United States was " interfering and pressing to augment the number of international staff and this is not legal and not justified . "
Iraq 's deputy ambassador , Saeed Hasan , noted that the May <number> accord said that the number of personnel would be determined by the United Nations and that the government of Iraq would be consulted .
Saeed in his comments did not threaten to call off the deal and the U.N. officials said they expected it to go into force next month after Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali reports that arrangements are in place .
The U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs ( DHA ) , which has to coordinate the distribution of food , medicine and other goods , increased the number of monitors earlier this month at the insistence of the United States .
According to U.N. officials and diplomats , Iraq would have about $ <number> billion to spend for food , medicine and other goods after monies for a reparations fund for Gulf War victims and costs for U.N. weapons inspections were deducted .
The cost of the U.N. staff overseeing the distribution of food and other supplies was estimated to cost $ <number> million .
In addition another $ <number> million was anticipated to cover other expenses , such as oil experts and administrative costs .
For the distribution and supervision of humanitarian supplies the United Nations estimated it needed <number> people , including <number> international staff and <number> Iraqi support staff .
Of this number <number> foreign and <number> local staff would be in the northern Kurdish provinces , no longer the direct control of the Baghdad government .
Another <number> international staff and <number> Iraqis would run the programme in the central and southern parts of the country .
There are also <number> monitors to watch oil flows , <number> customs experts and four New York-based oil experts or overseers to approve contracts .
Yasushi Akashi , the DHA undersecretary-general , told the Security Council last week that the " financial requirements to support the ( humanitarian ) programme represent a very modest percentile of the total ...
roughly <number> percent . "

EU Commission cool on changing beef cull plan .
BRUSSELS <number>
The European Commission said on Thursday it would study scientific reports saying Britain 's mad cow epidemic would die out by <number> but offered little prospect the findings would change an agreed slaughter campaign .
" Obviously we are interested in this research .
We will ask the ( EU ) scientific and veterinary committee to examine it , " Commission spokesman Gerard Kiely told Reuters .
But he added that new research into the dynamics of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) , a fatal brain-wasting disease suffered by cattle , was unlikely to alter a slaughter plan agreed by Britain and its <number> EU partners .
" We agreed that following detailed scientific analysis using a methodology which would take out the maximum number of BSE cases possible .
I think it would be very difficult to sell to the European Commission a programme which would involve the elimination of fewer BSE cases , " Kiely said .
" We will look at our approach ( to the plan ) but we wo n't get involved with the number of animals to be slaughtered , " he said .
" We have always avoided the question of numbers of animals to be slaughtered , that 's not the issue .
The issue is the protection of consumers ' health and the rapid eradication of BSE , " he added .
The reaction is likely to disappoint British farmers , who seized on research by Oxford scientists in the scientific journal Nature saying it would be hard to get rid of the disease any faster than <number> without killing vast numbers of cattle .
The researchers predicted there would be <number> new infections and <number> new cases of BSE before <number> .
British farmers ' leader called on Wednesday for an urgent meeting with ministers to discuss the report .
" I hope the government will now make it clear they believe there is a better way of dealing with this issue , " National Farmers Union president Sir David Naish told BBC radio .
Naish said there was no need for Britain to carry out a planned cull of some <number> cattle to which it had reluctantly agreed to placate its European partners .
" The new evidence to me means some of that proposal should be re-examined because we could get away with considerably less animals being culled if in fact scientists throughout Europe accepted this evidence , " Naish said .
The report could well reopen a damaging row between Britain and the EU , which slapped a worldwide ban on British beef after the government said there could be a link between BSE and the human form of the disease .
The issue flared in in March when government scientists admitted that people could become infected with Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease ( CJD ) from eating BSE-infected beef .

TENNIS - MARTINEZ GETS AGGRESSIVE AT U.S. OPEN .
Larry Fine
NEW YORK <number>
Conchita Martinez decided that when in New York , do as the New Yorkers do -- and the Spaniard 's new-found aggressiveness seems to have put her in the right frame of mind for the U.S. Open .
The fourth-seeded Spaniard , who is tackling the world class traffic of New York City as a warm-up by driving to the tennis centre for her matches , ran over France 's Nathalie Tauziat <number> <number> on Wednesday to take her place in the third round .
" I 've been trying my whole career to be aggressive , " said the <number> Martinez after crushing Tauziat in just over an hour .
" What I 'm trying to do is be aggressive all the time , maybe go up to the net a few times like I did tonight .
That would really help . "
Martinez , the <number> Wimbledon champion , used to struggle at the Open , but has come to terms with the noise , crowds and chaos .
" There is a lot of things that can happen , " Martinez said about her early difficulties adjusting to tennis on the cement at Flushing Meadows .
" Like traffic .
We stay in Manhattan and it 's a long way to come .
The crowds , they speak louder or they move .
That does n't happen in other Grand Slams .
That 's where the real champion wins .
You have to concentrate for these two weeks . "
It took Martinez four Opens to get as far as the quarters , and another four to match that .
Last year , Martinez , who finished <number> ranked second in the world , reached the semifinals before bowing out to Monica Seles .
Now she feels she is in the swing of things .
" I have my own car now and that helps , " said Martinez .
" Sometimes the transportation they ( the tournament ) provide gets a little messed up .
This time it did n't happen .
I do the driving and I love it .
It gets my adrenalin going , those taxi drivers .
" We change lanes all the time in Barcelona .
I 'm used to it and I like to drive fast . "

Nigeria would not refuse Commonwealth officials .
LAGOS <number>
Nigeria would not object to a visit by Commonwealth officials but insists its suspension from the organisation be resolved before any other questions are addressed , Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi said on Thursday .
Ikimi reiterated his position that the Commonwealth had no mandate to send a fact-finding mission .
" The request I have received is for their officials to come and talk to my officials .
We cannot object to people wanting to visit Nigeria , " Ikimi told Reuters by telephone from the capital Abuja .
" The fundamental problem we have with the Commonwealth is our unfair suspension .
Any discussions we have at ministerial level will be a continuation of what we began in London on that .
Before that is accomplished we cannot address anything else . "
Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth in November after the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority rights activists in defiance of international pleas for clemency .
A meeting of Commonwealth ministers in London on Wednesday said it planned to send a team of senior officials to Nigeria as soon as possible to persuade Abuja to accept a fact-finding mission .
The timing of that mission has yet to be determined .
The latest diplomatic row between Nigeria 's military government and the club of Britain and its former colonies erupted over the terms of a visit by Commonwealth ministers to discuss Nigeria 's suspension .
Nigeria said they would be restricted to a two-day meeting with government officials , but the Commonwealth said it wanted to hold meetings with people outside the government and called off the visit .

Kornblum , Milosevic discuss election crisis .
Peter Greste
BELGRADE <number>
U.S. envoy John Kornblum met Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic on Thursday in an effort to defuse a growing crisis surrounding Bosnia 's post-war elections .
The American diplomat arrived in Belgrade two days after international organisers postponed municipal elections in Bosnia due to irregularities in the registration of Serb refugee voters .
" We discussed the decision to postpone the municipal elections and I made clear it was primarily the manipulation of voter registration by the Republika Srpska ( Bosnian Serb republic ) which led to this development , " Kornblum said after three hours of talks .
But he said the United States still believed it was important to go ahead with national elections in Bosnia as scheduled on September <number> to bolster the peace process .
Kornblum gave no indication that he had won any specific commitment from Milosevic , the patron of the Bosnian Serbs , to rectify any abuses in the registration process .
Bosnia 's Moslem political parties have urged their refugees to boycott the elections until irregularities with voter registration are resolved .
Human rights workers say Serbian and Bosnian Serb authorities coerced refugees to register only in Serb-held territory in Bosnia to solidify the results of wartime expulsions and military conquest .
Serbian officials have denied any abuses occurred during a <number> registration period and the Bosnian Serbs , angry at the postponement of municipal elections , have threatened to hold local polls on their territory without the international community 's blessing .
Kornblum said only elections endorsed by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) would be legitimate .
" As we have said publicly before , if there is any effort to do so ( hold local elections ) these elections will not be valid , " he said . "
The elections which are valid are those conducted by the international community under the management of the OSCE . "
After meeting Milosevic , Kornblum flew to the Croatian capital Zagreb .
He was due to head to the Bosnian town of Banja Luka on Friday to meet Bosnian Serb acting president Biljana Plavsic and Bosnian Serb opposition leaders .
He also planned to travel to Sarajevo to oversee the formal dissolution of the separatist Croat mini-state in western Bosnia .
U.N. police , relief workers and NATO officers have reported a rise in political violence across Bosnia in the run-up to the September <number> elections .
Voters will be choosing a three-member presidency and a parliament to rule over a loose union of Bosnia , comprised of a Serb republic and a Moslem-Croat federation .

Pre-electoral bickering flared on Wednesday in the troubled western Mexican state of Guerrero as some opposition politicians demanded the army pull out of the area ahead of an upcoming state poll .

Banharn , who leads a six-party , <number> coalition government , faces a no-confidence debate in parliament next month .
The prime minister , who has already lost one coalition partner this month , is expected to have a tough battle in the debate because of infighting in his own party and warnings of more pullouts by other coalition partners .

Scandal hits Clinton campaign at vital moment .
Michael Conlon
CHICAGO <number>
President Bill Clinton 's triumphal appearance at the Democratic convention , a vital moment in his bid for a second term , was marred on Thursday by the resignation of a top adviser in a reported sex scandal .
Clinton was at work on the nomination acceptance speech that will launch his <number> re-election campaign when political strategist Dick Morris abruptly announced his resignation on Thursday .
The tabloid Star magazine reported the married Morris had a lengthy affair with a $ <number> prostitute who he allowed to eavesdrop on telephone conversations with Clinton , and with whom he shared White House speeches before they were made .
" Dick Morris is my friend , and he is a superb political strategist , " Clinton said in a written statement . "
I am and always will be grateful for the great contributions he has made to my campaigns and for the invaluable work he has done for me over the last two years . "
Morris declined to address the allegations directly in his resignation statement but said he was quitting to avoid becoming a campaign issue .
The surprise development captivated the thousands of reporters at the convention and clearly worried some Democrats , who had planned a triumphal celebration of Clinton 's lead over Dole in the opinion polls .
Senator Dianne Feinstein , a California Democrat , called it a " big bump " in the way of the Clinton campaign .
" It comes at the worst possible time on one of the biggest days for the president , " Feinstein said .
Clinton was to deliver his acceptance speech at the final session of the Democratic Convention opening at <number> p.m. EDT ( midnight GMT ) .
The <number> president has been dogged for years by allegations of financial wrongdoing , sexual misconduct and questionable judgment in selecting his advisers .
Republicans hope to seize on the " character " issue to bolster Clinton 's challenger Bob Dole in the final weeks of the campaign .
Speaking in Santa Barbara , California , Dole did not directly refer to the sexual scandal but said the departure of Morris , who had advised Clinton to chart a more centrist political course , would make Clinton drift back to the left .
" Morris has been trying to make President Clinton a Republican , now maybe he 'll revert to the liberal Democrat that he really is , " Dole told reporters .
Clinton will hit the road on Friday for a bus tour across several states in his fight to become the first Democratic incumbent re-elected to a second term since the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt .
Aides said Clinton planned to spend most of Thursday in his hotel room several miles ( km ) from the convention hall working on his speech .
It was apparently neglected on his long " whistle-stop " train trip to the convention , during which he revelled in contact with friendly crowds across the country 's heartland .
He was also hoarse and was giving his voice a rest .
But first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton told ABC television , " He 's really fired up . "
" He wants to outline to the American people what he thinks has been accomplished in the last four years , and what he would like to see done in the next four years , " she said .
" He 's very excited about this convention ...
He 's excited about the campaign .
But more than that , he 's very resolute about what he wants to do . "
" I do n't take anything for granted .
I always expect elections to get close .
I expect to have a great deal of up and down days between now and then , " she said of the November <number> election date .
Clinton is leading Dole by as much as <number> points according to some polls .
The campaign pits Dole , a man of quick and withering wit and long-time public service , but stilted speaking style , against the glib and confident Clinton , who has perfected a style that makes direct eye contact with his audience .

Researchers report progress in muscular dystrophy .
PHILADELPHIA <number>
University of Pennsylvania researchers on Thursday said a new gene-therapy technique for treating muscular dystrophy disease had shown progress in laboratory animals .
Word of the findings , to be published in the Oct. <number> issue of the journal " Human Gene Therapy , " came in advance of the annual Jerry Lewis Labour Day weekend telethon to raise money for muscular dystrophy research .
Several hurdles must be overcome before the method is used in human trials .
Nevertheless , " a treatment based on the new strategy .... may have the potential to benefit many patients , " the University of Pennsylvania Medical Centre said in a release .
Muscular dystrophy is a fatal illness in which the body 's muscle tissue degenerates and is replaced by fat .
Death strikes in early adulthood .
Individuals with the disease have a non-working version of a gene responsible for producing a crucial muscle protein called dystrophin .
In the study at the University 's Institute for Human Gene Therapy , researchers altered a common-cold virus to carry a version of the working dystrophin gene .
The virus , which also was altered to minimise its susceptibility to the immune system , was then injected into the muscle cells of mice bred to lack dystrophin genes .
In the experiment , between <number> to <number> percent of the muscle fibers in one group of mice produced dystrophin for two weeks before diminishing .
Similar results had been obtained previously in test-tube cell cultures , but not in live animals , the university said .
The university said methods are still needed to make enough of the altered virus to treat humans , to further decrease the immune-system response to the virus , and to deliver the virus to human muscle tissue .

O.J. Simpson hints at more supporting evidence .
Jackie Frank
WASHINGTON <number>
O.J. Simpson said on Thursday he was financially broken by his defence against murder charges but he was hopeful new evidence to support him would be available for a civil trial next month .
The former football star was found not guilty by a criminal trial jury last October of the murders of his former wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend , Ronald Goldman , in June <number> .
He now faces a civil suit brought by families of the victims who hold him responsible for the deaths .
He told reporters a court order not to talk about his case kept him from detailing how he has fulfilled his pledge to find the killers .
But he added without elaborating , " hopefully we will see some things come out in this next trial . "
The judge in the civil trial has imposed a sweeping gag order that prohibits lawyers , witnesses and parties to the case from discussing it with the media or elsewhere in public .
" I would love to speak about everything , " said Simpson , who vowed after his acquittal to find the killers and offered a substantial reward .
His lawyers have said his defence in the civil trial that starts Sept .
<number> will be that he did not kill the victims .
Simpson said at the hotel news conference his plans include eventually writing another book .
He added that he has had job offers but more have come from abroad than at home .
" I 'm broke .
I am not crying the blues .
I can get along just fine , " he said . "
Whatever you want to send me , I need . "
He again accused the news media of erroneous reporting on his case but did not signal any plans for lawsuits as he did on Wednesday in an address at a jam-packed Washington church .
Contrary to news reports , Simpson said , he has received support from both blacks and whites .
He again dismissed charges that he had distanced himself from the black community during his successful football and commercial career , only to seek their support after he faced murder charges .
A crowd of <number> paid $ <number> a head to hear the former star running back for the Buffalo Bills professional football club and a Football Hall of Fame member on Wednesday night .
The crowd in the church was wildly supportive , showering Simpson with gifts and praise .
But outside , dozens of protesters from the D.C. Coalition Against Domestic Violence called for the church to support victims of violence instead .
